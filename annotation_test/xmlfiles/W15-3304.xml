This accounting is especially important in Mandarin Chi- nese which makes extensive usage of un- bounded dependencies. However, parsers trained on existing categorial grammar an- notations (Tse and Curran, 2010) extracted from the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) are not as accurate as those trained on the original treebank, possibly because enforcing a small set of infer- ence rules in these grammars leads to large sets of categories, which cause sparse data problems. This work reannotates the Penn Chinese Treebank into a generalized cat- egorial grammar which uses a larger rule set and a substantially smaller category set while retaining the capacity to model un- bounded dependencies. Experimental re- sults show a statistically significant im- provement in parsing accuracy with this categorial grammar. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>Categorial grammar annotations are attractive be- cause they have a transparent syntactic-semantic interface and provide a natural account of traces (Rimell et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2012). This is especially important in parsing Chinese, which generates 1.5 times as many traces as English and makes heavy use of unbounded dependen- cies (Kummerfeld et al., 2013). Unfortunately, the accuracy of parsers trained on existing cate- gorial grammar reannotations (Chinese CCGbank; Tse and Curran, 2010) of the Penn Chinese Tree- bank (Xue et al., 2005) is much lower than that of parsers trained on the original Treebank (Tse and Curran, 2012). This may be because previous attempts used Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000; Steedman, 2012), which is strongly lexicalized (Karttunen, 1989), using a small set of language-independent rules and con- sequently a large set of language-dependent cate- gories. This strong lexicalization may contribute to sparse data problems. This work reannotates the Penn Chinese Tree- bank into a moderately lexicalized generalized categorial grammar, similar to that defined for En- glish by Nguyen et al (2012), which uses a larger set of language-specific inference rules and a sub- stantially smaller category set. Experimental re- sults show a statistically significant gain in parsing accuracy from this moderately lexicalized gram- mar over parsing with a strongly lexicalized CCG. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Grammar Framework </heading><chunk>A generalized categorial grammar (GCG; Bach, 1981; Nguyen et al., 2012) 1 is a tuple P, O, R, W, M (Oehrle, 1994) consisting of a set P of primitive category types, a set O of type- constructing operators, a set R of inference rules, a set W of vocabulary items, and a mapping M from vocabulary items to complex category types. A set of complex category types C may then be defined as: P C; C O C C; nothing else is in C. The mapping M in a GCG defines a category type c and a constraint function g encoded by each lexeme w W, using the notation w c : g. En- coded constraints are expressed using dependency functions, 2 labeled with dependency types or argu- ment position numbers: f 0 , f 1 , f 2 , etc. For exam- ple, a constraint function g may consist of a sin- gle 0-labeled dependency to a constant people: 1 Nguyen et al (2012) notate the // and \\ operators of Bach (1981) as -g and -h, mnemonic for gap and heavy shift. 2 Dependencies shown here can be interpreted as a shorthand for distributed representations of sentence mean- ings compatible with cognitive computational neuroscientific models of episodic memory (Schuler and Wheeler, 2014). 25 x (f 0 x)=people. 3 Chinese Syntax in GCG Chinese is typically an SVO language, but it also has several SOV constructions, such as the focus constructions triggered by lian even, or the ba construction, where the affected patient is moved to the preverbal position. Most adverbial modi- fiers are pre-verbal and most nominal modifiers, including relative clauses, are pre-nominal. The set of primitive category types for Man- darin Chinese, P, P C, contains the following primitive categories, generally labeled with the part of speech of the head of the category: V: verb-headed clause N: noun-headed phrase or clause D: de-clause C: cardinal number Q: quantificational phrase A: adjectival phrase or nominal modifier R: adverbial phrase or verbal modifier B: verbal complement of ba E: verbal complement of bei The set of type-constructing operators O for Mandarin Chinese includes -a and -b operators for unsatisfied requirements of preceding or suc- ceeding arguments, -c and -d operators for unsatis- fied requirements of preceding or succeeding con- juncts, and a -g operator for unsatisfied require- ments of gap categories. 3 A GCG category con- sists of a primitive category followed by one or more unsatisfied dependencies, each consisting of an operator followed by another category. The set of inference rules R is described below. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.1 Argument composition </heading><chunk>The basic operation of most categorial grammars is argument composition. However, unlike most categorial grammars, the GCG described in this paper defines composition rules to explicitly en- code dependencies between lexical items. Specif- ically, inference rules for argument composition are defined as follows, where c C, p P and each {-a, -b} C: c:g p 1..n-1 -ac:h p 1..n-1 : x g (f n x) (h x) (Aa) p 1..n-1 -bc:g c:h p 1..n-1 : x (g x) h (f n x) (Ab) 3 Following (Nguyen et al., 2012), directional operators such as forward and backward slashes (\ and /) are not used because some operators, such as gap operators in tough constructions, are undirected. The first composition rule Aa stipulates that when a predicate h of category p 1..n-1 -ac takes a preceding argument g of category c as its n-th argument, the syntactic dependency that g is hs n-th argument is added. The second composition rule Ab is an argument composition rule taking a succeeding argument. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.2 Modifier composition </heading><chunk>Inference rules for modifier composition apply preceding or succeeding modifiers of category p-bd to modificands of category c, where p {A, R}, d {N, V}: p-bd:g c:h c: x y (g y) (h x) (f 1 y)=x (Ma) c:g p-bd:h c: x y (g x) (h y) (f 1 y)=x (Mb) The modifier composition rules Ma and Mb estab- lish a 1-labeled dependency from the modifier to the modificand. With argument and modifier com- position rules, we can derive the Chinese sentence shown in (1). (1) Shanghai, in the aspect of finance, develops fast. Shanghai N at R-bV-bN finance N aspect N-aN Ab N Aa R-bV develop V-aN fast R-bV Mb V-aN Ma V-aN Aa V The separate modifier composition rules in GCG make it possible to reuse modifier categories across different contexts. For example, in (1), in the aspect of finance is an adver- bial modifier, having the category R-bV. It has the same category when the phrase is a sentential modifier as shown in (2). Consequently, at in both (1) and (2) has the same category R-bV-bN, which means it takes a succeeding nominal argu- ment to become an adverbial modifier. (2) In the aspect of finance, Shanghai develops fast. at R-bV-bN finance N aspect N-aN Ab N Aa R-bV Shanghai N develop V-aN fast R-bV Mb V-aN Aa V Mb V In contrast, since CCG enforces a restricted set of inference rules, it needs to provide two differ- ent categories, (S\NP)/(S\NP)/NP and S/S/NP for in (1) and (2). In total, Chinese CCGbank 26 has 91 different categories for , since the prepo- sitional phrase headed by can modify con- stituents of various syntactic categories. In con- trast, Chinese GCG annotations only have 9 dif- ferent categories for . Another example of differing lexicalization is the category of the tense aspect in Chinese, which can either occur immediately after a verb or after the whole verb phrase to indicate past tense. Although generalized backward crossed composi- tion (Steedman, 2000) helps aspect/tense particles in Chinese usually retain their canonical category (S\NP)\(S\NP), there are still 59 different cate- gories for in Chinese CCGbank (Tse and Cur- ran, 2010), and most of them are semantically in- distinguishable. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.3 Nominal and quantificational expressions </heading><chunk>Mandarin Chinese does not have determiners such as the or a in English, so there is no empiri- cal motivation to distinguish NP and N categories. However, classifiers or measure words, glossed as M in (3), are obligatory when a noun is quanti- fied by a number. This unit of measure is needed for quantification of nouns because the lack of number morphology in Chinese makes all nouns behave as mass nouns (Allan, 1977; Borer, 2005). (3) three people three C M Q-bN-aC Aa Q-bN people N Ab Q We propose a separate category Q for quantifica- tional expressions because they can be predicative, as in (4), which makes them different from com- mon nouns. A zero-head rule Z, where c, d, e C, converts the Q category to V-aN to make the quan- tificational expression predicative. e:g c-ad: x (f 0 x)=pred g (f 2 x) (Z) (4) He is three. he N three C years old Q-aC Aa Q Z V-aN ASP R-bV Mb V-aN Aa V Classifiers like years, years-old and day already contain the nominal information, so they do not require nominal arguments like other classifiers. Classifiers of this type have a differ- ent category Q-aC to reflect this combinational difference. By doing so, the numbers receive the same category C in both three days, and three people. However, in both Chinese Treebank and CCGbank, the category M is used for both types of classifiers, which results in num- bers like three having the category QP/M in three days and the category (NP/NP)/M in three people in Chinese CCGbank. This is not de- sirable because it expends training examples on an artificial distinction between the numbers three in each of these expressions, which are se- mantically the same. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.4 Topicalization </heading><chunk>Topicalization in Mandarin can involve either movement of a topicalized constituent or not. The topicalization which involves movement is similar to that of English, in which the object is usually moved to the sentence initial position and a gap is left behind, as shown in (5). 4 (5) The rice, I ate. rice N I N ate V-aN-bN Ga V-aN-gN Ac V-gN Fa V The non-movement topicalization occurs much more frequently in Mandarin, in which the subject of the sentence usually has an association rela- tion to the topic, as shown in (6). (6) Of him, the appetite is good. he N appetite N Gc N-gN good V-aN Ac V-gN Fa V The referent of the subject in the non-movement topicalization needs to be further specified by the topic. Although topics are seen to be associated with other constituents of the sentence, especially in colloquial expressions, only associations with subjects are observed in the Treebank data. There- fore in our analysis of this type of topicaliza- tion, the subject undergoes a unary type conver- sion from N to N-gN to introduce a gap, which is 4 The verb and the tense particle are separate tokens, shown together here to simplify the derivation. We apply the same simplification to in following examples. 27 later discharged by the topic to capture the asso- ciation relation between the subject and the topic. Inference rules for gap composition are: p 1..n-1 oc p 1..n-1 -gc: vx (g x) (f n x)=v (Ga) c:g c-gd: vx (g x) (f 1 v)=x (Gb) N:g N-gN: vx (g x) e (de-asso e x v) (Gc) where p P, o {-a, -b}, c C, d {A-bN, R-bV} and {-a, -b} C. Rule Ga hypothesizes a gap as a preceding or succeeding argument, rule Gb hypothesizes a nominal or adverbial modifier gap and rule Gc hypothesizes a gap which is associated with the subject in topicalization. Non-local arguments, each consisting of a non- local operator and argument category {-g} C, are then propagated to consequents from all pos- sible combinations of antecedents. For d:g e:h c:( f g h) {Aab, Mab}: d 1..m :g e m+1..n :h c 1..n : v 1..n f (g v 1..m ) (h v m+1..n ) (Acd, Mcd) Rules Acd and Mcd stipulate non-local prop- agation through argument and modifier composi- tion. Inference rules for filler attachment apply gapped clauses to topicalized phrases as fillers. For c C, and p P: p:g c-gp:h c: x y (g y) (h y x) (Fa) In contrast, Tse and Curran (2010) analyze the topic in non-movement topicalization as a senten- tial modifier, which gives he in (6) the cate- gory S/S, serving as a sentential modifier for the sentence appetite is good. This anal- ysis conflates sentential adverbial modifiers such as today with topics such as he in (6), yielding incorrect dependencies and expending probability mass on ungrammatical derivations (e.g.with top- ics conjoined with adverbs). </chunk></section><section><heading>3.5 Relative and appositive clauses </heading><chunk>In Mandarin relative clauses, the particle de takes a preceding clause containing a gap to form a relative clause modifying a succeeding noun. The modified noun is the filler of the gap in the relative clause. The inference rules for relative clauses ap- ply the gapped de-clause to the modificand as a filler. For c C: D-gc:g N:h N: x (h x) y (g x y) (R) A GCG analysis of a relative clause with an ob- ject gap is shown in (7). (7) fish that cats eat cat N eat V-aN-bN Ga V-aN-gN Ac V-gN de D-aV Ac D-gN fish N R N Our analysis of topicalization in (6) makes it easy to account for a relative clause which relativizes a topic. In (6) for example, relativizing the topic he yields a nominal phrase containing a non- restrictive relative clause , he whose appetite is good. A GCG analysis of this nominal phrase is shown in (8). (8) he whose appetite is very good appetite N Gc N-gN very-good V-aN Ac V-gN de D-aV Ac D-gN he N R N Appositive clauses in Mandarin Chinese are formed with the same de particle used in rel- ative clauses. However, unlike relative clauses, appositive clauses do not involve any gap con- stituent. In this GCG analysis of appositive clauses, de receives the same category as it does in relative clauses. But the noun which takes an appositive clause as complement has the cate- gory N-aD to take a preceeding de-clause to fur- ther specify the content of the noun. An appositive clause in this grammar is shown in (9). (9) the idea that high tech cannot be reached high tech N cannot-be-reached V-aN Aa V de D-aV Aa D idea N-aD Aa N In the analyses described above, relative clauses with different types of gaps are differentiated, and relative clauses in general receive different analy- ses than appositive clauses. In the analysis of Tse and Curran (2010), a relative clause can only have either a subject or object gap in Chinese. Rela- tive clauses that relativize topics receive the same categories as appositive clauses. This analysis blurs the distributional difference between certain types of relative clauses and appositive clauses, decreasing PCFG estimates of both types of rel- ative clauses given the same (conflated) category. 28 (a) Bei V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN T V-aN-b(E-aN-gN) titled-as B-aN-aN-bN Chinese-national-liquor N Ab B-aN-aN T E-aN-bN Ga E-aN-gN Fc V-aN Ga V-gN de D-aV Aa D-gN Maotaijiu N R N history N Gc N-gN long V-aN Ac V-gN Fa V (b) de-asso bei titled-as Chinese national liquor de Maotaijiu history long 2 3 2 1 1 2 1 1 Figure 1: GCG derivation:Maotaijiu, which is titled as the Chinese national liquor, has a long history (a) and its associated dependencies (b) </chunk></section><section><heading>3.6 Ba and bei constructions </heading><chunk>Ba constructions in Mandarin Chinese require the affected patients of certain verbs to occur before the verb, instead of after the verb. For example, fish in (10) is the object of eat and it occurs before the verb eat. In the Penn Tree- bank, ba takes a clause as argument. Therefore, fish ate in (10) is analyzed as a clausal complement of ba. This analysis makes fish the subject of the verb eat, instead of the object. Consequently, for example, Stanford dependen- cies extracted from Treebank annotations of this sentence have both nsubj (eat, cat) and nsubj (eat, fish), which is not correct. (10) the cat ate the fish cat N ba V-aN-b(B-aN) fish N ate V-aN-bN T B-aN-aN Aa B-aN Ab V-aN Aa V In our analysis, we propose that the particle ba takes a ba-verb as its complement. Ba-verbs are derived from transitive verbs with the type conver- sion rule given below. 5 5 This rule is constrained by fact that the function g is pre- served, and its usage is constrained by parsing probabilities for particular categories. Following Featherston (2005) and Crocker and Keller (2005), the model described in this pa- per assumes that grammaticality judgements are gradient and determined by probabilities of compositional inferences oc- curring in the experience of a particular language user. c:g d:g (T) Using the type conversion rule T, we change a transitive verb V-aN-bN to B-aN-aN to capture the fact that the verb that occurs within a ba con- struction takes a preceeding second argument. The particle ba is assigned the category V- aN-b(B-aN), with coindexation between the ref- erent of its subject (f 1 x) and the referent of the subject of its complement (f 1 (f 2 x)). ba V-aN-b(B-aN): x (f 0 x)=ba (f 1 x)=(f 1 (f 2 x)) Usually, the affected patient is the direct object of a transitive verb, as shown in (10), but there are cases where some verbs can only occur in ba constructions or bei constructions. These types of verbs are ba-verbs to begin with and do not need to be changed from transitive verbs. They are given the general category B-aN-aN-bN. Many resulta- tive verbs (VRD, in treebank annotation) have this category. An example is given in (11). (11) We built Chongming into a port. we N ba V-aN-b(B-aN) Chongming N build-into B-aN-aN-bN port N Ab B-aN-aN Aa B-aN Ab V-aN Aa V Mandarin Chinese uses the particle bei to construct passive sentences. In bei constructions, 29 the patient argument of a verb, usually the sec- ond argument of a transitive verb or a ba-verb, is moved to the subject position of the clause. We propose the particle bei takes a bei-verb as its complement. Bei-verbs, which are of the category E-aN-gN, are derived from E-aN-bN by introduc- ing a gap by rule Ga. E-aN-bN is derived by the type conversion rule T from V-aN-bN or B-aN- aN, transitive verbs or ba-verbs. Here is the lexi- cal entry we propose for the bei particle. bei V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN: x (f 0 x)=bei (f 3 x)=(f 1 (f 2 x)) The lexical entry of bei stipulates that the first argument of bei is the subject of its second ar- gument, the VP complement, E-aN-gN. Since the agent in the passive voice construction is optional (as it is in passive voice in English), the category of the bei particle can have a type change from V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN to V-aN-b(E-aN-gN). The inference rule (Fc) is proposed for the composi- tion of gap dependencies contained within suc- ceeding arguments, where p P, {-a, -b}C, and {-g}C. p 1...n1 -b(d):g d:h p: x h (f 1 x) (f n x) g x (Fc) Using rule Fc, the first argument of the bei particle becomes the filler of the gap in the bei verb. This rule also supports an analysis of tough construc- tions in Chinese. An example bei-construction which contains a transitive verb is shown in (12). (12) The fish was eaten by the cat. fish N bei V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN cat N Ab V-aN-b(E-aN-gN) ate V-aN-bN T E-aN-bN Ga E-aN-gN Fc V-aN Aa V The Penn Treebank uses the category LB for the bei particle where the optional agent argument occurs, and SB for the bei particle where it is elided. Tse and Curran (2010) follow the Treebank annotation, proposing two different categories for the bei particle. For example the CCG category for LB is (S\NP y )/(S\NP x /NP y )/NP x , in which a coindexation scheme is used to ensure that the sub- ject of bei is coindexed with the object of its verbal complement. The ba particle, with the category (S\NP y )/(S\NP y /NP x )/NP x , is different from bei only in the coindexing scheme. However, if the passivized verb is not a transitive verb, such as titled-as in Figure 1, it is hard to infer what the coindexing scheme should be like in the CCG analysis. Figure 1 shows a GCG derivation of a sentence from the Chinese Treebank. We use this sentence to illustrate how topicalization, passive voice, and relative clauses are analyzed in the GCG frame- work and what kind of dependencies we can ex- tract from GCG derivations. </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Experiments </heading><chunk>We use a set of reannotation rules similar to those described by Nguyen et al. (2012) to reannotate the Penn Chinese Treebank into GCG trees. These reannotation rules work within a perl script that traverses each bracketed sentence in the Penn Chi- nese Treebank by selecting each pair of match- ing brackets from the top of the tree to the bot- tom, then running a sed-like pattern substitution rule on each selection. With around 200 annota- tion rules, we currently fully annotate 71% of sen- tences (18,505 sentences out of 26,062) from the Penn Chinese Treebank 5 and 6. In order to evaluate the Chinese GCG annota- tions in terms of parsing accuracy, we compare the parsing performance of a latent-variable parser trained on Chinese GCG annotations with that of the same parser trained on Chinese CCG annota- tions. The Chinese CCGbank is obtained by con- verting the Penn Chinese Treebank into CCG an- notations according to Tse and Curran (2012). 6 We divided the fully annotated sentences in both grammars into training, development and test sec- tions according to the section divisions suggested by Tse and Curran (2012). In order to have a better understanding of how the parsing perfor- mance changes with the size of the training data, we trained the Chinese CCG parser on both the full training set (ccg.full) and the same training set used for training the Chinese GCG parser (ccg.same). The detailed section divisions are shown in Table 1. For the two CCG parsers, ccg.full and ccg.same, we use the Petrov and Klein (2007) latent variable PCFG trainer, with 5 split-merge cycles, which is the best setting indicated by Tse and Curran (2012). As with CCG, we ran the Petrov et al. 6 https://github.com/jogloran/cnccgbank 30 Model Train Dev Test ccg.full 22680 689 1986 ccg.same 13677 689 1986 gcg 13677 689 1986 Table 1: Train/Dev/Test Split R P F tag ccg.same 78.64 78.96 78.80 85.62 ccg.full 80.69 81.13 80.91 87.24 gcg 82.70 83.86 83.28 93.65 Table 2: Parsing results on the development set (2006) latent-variable PCFG trainer on the GCG- reannotated training corpus. The PCFG trainer was used off the shelf and run with its default pa- rameters, only varying the number of split-merge iterations on the development section. We found 5 split-merge iterations yielded the best parsing per- formance in the development section. Tables 2 and 3 show the parsing performance of the parsers on the development and test sets. The parsing results show that a larger training set is beneficial to the parsing performance of the Chi- nese CCG parer; the parsing performance of the CCG parser trained on the full training set per- forms consistently better than the parser trained on 71% of the training set. The GCG parser, trained on 71% of the training set, seems to parse rea- sonably well even compared with the CCG parser trained on the full training set. It is worth noting that the GCG parser is much higher in tagging ac- curacy than the CCG parser, which supports our hypothesis that the CCG parser might suffer from sparse data problems. However, direct comparison of the parsing per- formance of these two parsers is not fair because these two grammars define different categories and different tree structures. In order to ensure a fair comparison between these grammars, it is neces- sary to have them produce exactly the same tar- get representation. In this experiment, we test the parsing performance of these two grammars on a common test set of sentences to which the two grammars assign the same tree structure when syntactic labels and unary branches are removed, see Figure 2. We found 984 sentences in the test set which have exactly the same unlabeled binary structures (Figure 2c) in both grammars. Table 4 shows the parsing results (F1) on parses with both syntactic category labels and unary branches removed (NoUnary+NoLab).

Since both grammars predict exactly the same binary tree structures with exactly the same (X) categories, significance testing is performed on these predictions using bootstrap resampling. Results in Table 4 show that the parsing per- formance of the Petrov and Klein (2007) parser trained on the GCG-reannotated corpus is more accurate with strong significance (p &lt; 0.001) than the same parser trained on the CCG-reannotated corpus of the same size. We observe a significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) of the GCG parser over the CCG parser trained on the full training set. We believe that the Chinese CCG parser suffers from data sparsity effects. Excluding those words which are only associated with one preterminal category, the lexical-categorial confusion rate is 3.45 for the Chinese CCG annotations and 2.59 for the Chinese GCG annotations, which is also reflected in the large gap (more than 5 points) be- tween their tagging accuracy. Enforcing a small set of language-independent inference rules in the Chinese CCG-annotations might have some for- mal appeal, but it leads to a large set of syntac- tic categories, many of which, such as nominal or adverbial modifiers, are syntactically or semanti- cally indistinguishable. Since the GCG described in this paper uses a larger set of inference rules and consequently fewer category labels, it suffers fewer sparse data effects. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Conclusion and discussion </heading><chunk>This paper has described a generalized catego- rial grammar for Mandarin Chinese, reannotated 31 V V-aN E-aN-gN E-aN-bN V-aN-bN eat-LE V-aN-b(E-aN-gN) N cat V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN bei N fish (a) A full tree V V-aN E-aN-gN eat-LE V-aN-b(E-aN-gN) N cat V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN bei N fish (b) A NoUnary Tree X X X eat-LE X X cat X bei X fish (c) A NoUnary+Nolab Tree Figure 2: Constructing common test set from the Penn Chinese Treebank. Unlike previous efforts using strongly lexicalized CCG (Tse and Curran, 2010), the reannotated corpus described in this paper adopts a policy of moderate lexical- ization, allowing both inference rules and lexical categories to be language-specific. This modera- tion offers considerable representational freedom, particularly in modeling Chinese ba-, bei-, and de- constructions, which make substantial use of un- bounded dependencies. Experimental results ap- pear to show that, while there may be some for- mal appeal to a small universal set of language- independent combinators (Steedman, 2000; Steed- man, 2002; Steedman, 2012), the large category set resulting from it might impose an empirical cost for parsing tasks. The reannotation rules are available at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ modelblocks. </chunk></section><section><heading>References </heading><chunk>Keith Allan. 1977. Classfiers.
