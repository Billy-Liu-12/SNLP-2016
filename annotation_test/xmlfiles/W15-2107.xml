We first tackle the annotation of surface- syntactic structures (SSyntS) as inspired by the Meaning-Text framework. Ex- clusively syntactic criteria are used when defining the surface-syntactic relations tagset. Our annotation scheme allows for a direct mapping between surface-syntax and a more semantics-oriented represen- tation, in particular predicate-argument structures. It has been applied to a corpus of Finnish, composed of 2,025 sentences related to weather conditions. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>The increasing prominence of statistical NLP ap- plications calls for creation of syntactic depen- dency treebanks, i.e., corpora that are annotated with syntactic dependency structures. However, creating a syntactic treebank is an expensive and laborious tasknot only because of the annotation itself, but also because a well-defined annotation schema is required. The schema must accurately reflect all syntactic phenomena of the annotated language, and, if the application for which the an- notation is made is deep (as deep parsing or deep sentence generation), also foresee how each of the syntactic phenomena is reflected at the deeper lev- els of the linguistic description. For Finnish, there are two well-known syntac- tic dependency-based treebanks: the Turku De- pendency Treebank (TDT), and the FinnTree- Bank. TDT, the most referenced corpus in Finnish (Haverinen et al., 2014), contains 15,126 sen- tences (204,399 tokens) from general discourse and uses a tagset of 53 relations (although just 46 are used at the syntactic layer), which is an adapta- tion of the Stanford Dependency (SD) schema for English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). The FinnTreeBank (Voutilainen et al., 2012) contains 19,764 sentences (169,450 tokens), mostly ex- tracted from a descriptive Finnish grammar, which are annotated using a reduced tagset of only 15 re- lations. 1 In what follows, we present an alternative anno- tation schema that is embedded in the framework of the Meaning-to-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel cuk, 1988). This schema is based on the separation of linguistic representations in accordance with their level of abstraction. Subsequently, we distin- guish between surface-syntactic (SSynt) and deep- syntactic (DSynt) annotations, and argue that this schema more adequately captures the syntactic annotation of Finnish. We designed our anno- tation scheme empirically, through various itera- tions over an air quality-related corpus of 2,025 sentences (35,830 tokens), which we make pub- licly available. However, since this paper focuses on the principles which underlie our annotation schema, rather than on the quality of the annotated resource itself, we do not provide an evaluation of the annotation quality. The next section outlines our annotation scheme for Finnish and discusses the main syntactic cri- teria for the identification of the individual rela- tion tags. Section 3 shows how the presented an- notation can be projected onto a deep-syntactic annotation, while Section 4 details the principal differences between the TDT annotation schema and ours, before some conclusions are presented in Section 5. 2 A surface-syntactic annotation of Finnish Our annotation schema for Finnish follows the methodology adopted for the elaboration of the 1 According to KORP -https://korp.csc.fi- the FTB with all its versions joined contains 4,386,152 sentences (76,532,636 tokens).

Taking into account a series of clearly cut syntactically-motivated criteria, a tagset of Finnish syntactic dependencies has been established. In what follows, we first present the SSynt relation tagset, and then discuss some of the main criteria applied for the identification of se- lected tags. </chunk></section><section><heading>2.1 The SSynt dependency tagset </heading><chunk>The SSynt annotation layer is language- dependent, and thus captures the idiosyncrasies of a specific language. An example of a Finnish surface-syntactic structure (SSyntS) is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: SSyntS of the sentence Tytt  o jonka n  ain eilen ennusti, ett  a huomenna sataa vett  a. The girl whom I saw yesterday predicted that tomorrow it will rain. The Finnish SSynt tagset contains 36 relations, which are presented and described in Table 1 along with their distinctive syntactic properties. For comparison, consider the Spanish tagset, shown in Table 2. As can be observed, many labels in the Finnish and Spanish tagsets are identical (e.g., clitic, modif, relat). This uniformity of labels across lan- guages is one of the major motivations behind the Universal Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2014). We also think that using the same la- bels across languages facilitates the understanding of the annotations but, unlike in the USD proposal, we make the different syntactic characteristics en- coded by identical relations in different languages explicit. Some prominent examples of relations with the same label in both tagsets, but with dif- ferent definitions are subj, obl obj and copul. The relation subj refers in both tagsets to the element that agrees with the verb in person and number, but in Finnish the relation is also defined with respect to the case: the dependent of this relation takes the case assigned by the verb. In Spanish, given that nominal phrases do not carry case (or, at least, they do not show any case marker), the case assign- ment is not used for the definition of the relation.

In Finnish, due to its case-inflected nouns, obl obj is defined as the relation that links verbs with objects contain- ing locative cases. Finally, copul is defined in both tagsets as the complement of copular verbs, which agrees with the subject in number. However, in the case of Spanish this element can cliticize, but in Finnish it cannot. In contrast, such relation labels as appos, coord or relat share exactly the same properties across the two languages. </chunk></section><section><heading>2.2 Syntactic criteria </heading><chunk>The syntactically-motivated criteria described in (Burga et al., 2014) were used for creating the Finnish SSynt tagset. In this section, some remarks about Finnish idiosyncrasies related to these criteria are detailed. Agreement: Two elements are involved in agreement if they share some morphological fea- tures, such as number, person or case. If such agreement arises because one element transmits those features to the other, we conclude that those elements are syntactically related. On the other hand, if an element that admits morphological variation does not vary according to its gover- nor/dependent, we can conclude that no agreement is involved in the dependency relation between the two. However, as already pointed out for Spanish (Burga et al., 2014), one has to be careful when analyzing agreement, because it depends not only on the licensing from the syntactic relation, but also on the Part-of-Speech (PoS) of each element. Thus, if the element to which the morphological feature(s) is (are) transmitted from another has a PoS that does not allow any morphological vari- ation or is lexically invariable, despite having a PoS that admits variability , the agreement will not be visible. Then, to evaluate if agreement actu- ally exists, one needs to use the prototypical head and dependent for each relation. 2 When apply- ing this criterion, it is also important to keep in mind that different syntactic relations allow differ- ent types of agreement, namely: i) head transmits features to dependent (e.g., modif ) (1a); ii) depen- dent transmits features to head (e.g., subj) (1b); and iii) dependent transmits features to a sibling 2 This point is important because the non-visibility of agreement can cause a wrong division of relations, as hap- pens in the TDT annotation scheme (see Section 4). 50 (e.g., copul) (1c). (1) Possible agreement transmissions: a. from head to dependent: m  ar  at k  adet wet (NOM,PL) hand (NOM, PL) modif b. from dependent to head: He laulavat. They (3,PL) sing (3,PL) subj c. between two siblings: Pojat ovat v  asyneit  a. The boys (PL) are tired (PL) subj copul Governed Adposition / Conjunction / Grammeme: Some relations require the presence of a preposition, a subordinating conjunction, or a grammeme (as, e.g., verbal finiteness or case). In Finnish, differently from English or Spanish, adpositions and inflected nouns are both admitted as alternative ways of expressing the same mean- ing. 3 However, beyond the way the meaning is conveyed at the surface, some units (namely the functional elements) are governed and some units (namely the content elements) are not. The gov- erned elements in Finnish are mostly grammemes (case features), although it is also possible to find specific examples with governed adpositions. In the annotation scheme presented in this paper, this criterion is used for establishing the tagset (e.g., the relation subj does not require a particular case the acquired case depends on the verbal head whereas the relation attr requires genitive in the dependent), but does not imply a different analysis of configurations with governed and non-governed elements. (2) Governed grammeme: pitoisuuksia verrataan raja-arvoihin. concentrations compare thresholds (PAR) (PASS) (ILL) Concentrations are compared to the threshold values. subj obj obl obj (3) Governed adposition: HY tekee yhteisty  ot  a Aalto-yliopiston kanssa. HY makes collaboration U.Aalto with (PAR) (GEN) U.Helsinki collaborates with U.Aalto. subj dobj noun compl postpos 3 This is the reason behind the TDT treating both kinds of configurations in the same way (see Section 4). (4) Non-governed grammeme: Mies k  aveli rannalla. man (NOM) walked beach (ADE) The man walked on the beach. subj adv (5) Non-governed adposition: Mies k  aveli rantaa pitkin. man (NOM) walked beach (PAR) along The man walked along the beach. subj adv postpos In (25), we display examples that illustrate gov- erned and non-governed cases and adpositions. In (2), the case ILL of raja-arvo threshold values is governed by the verb vertaa compare, and this requirement is what defines the type of relation holding between the verb and the inflected noun (obl obj). In (3), the postposition kanssa is re- quired by the predicate tehd  a yhteisty  ot  a collabo- rate, which motivates the relation noun compl. 4 On the other hand, the adessive case in ranta beach in (4) and the adposition pitkin along in (5) are not required by any element. As a conse- quence, they contribute by themselves to the se- mantics of the sentences which should be re- flected at the deep-syntactic layer. Linearization / Canonical order: 5 By lin- earization/canonical order we make reference to the required (or preferred) direction between gov- ernor and dependent within a specific dependency relation. Although Finnish is a language with a quite flexible word order, there are certain syntac- tic relations that require a rigid linearization (e.g., appos) or, at least, prefer a certain order between head and dependent (e.g., dobj, copul). As these criteria contribute to the definition of SSynt relations, they also serve, along with some features of the elements involved, to distinguish different syntactic configurations. For instance, the verb olla to be is used in copulative, loca- tive, and existential configurations. Therefore, we need some criteria to identify each of these uses. In a copulative sentence, the subject is the ele- ment that agrees in person and number with the 4 As the predicate comprises two elements, and the predi- cate itself is a noun, the relation is noun compl. However, if the predicate were composed by just one verbal element, the relation received by the adposition would be the same as in (2), obl obj. 5 Thanks to a reviewer for providing some important Finnish judgments that have contributed to clarify this sec- tion. 51 verb and carries nominative case. The comple- ment of the copula, on the other hand, is the el- ement that says something about the subject. It can be of four different types: i) a non-nominal el- ement (such as an adjective), ii) a nominal element in a case different from nominative, iii) a nomi- nal element in nominative that does not agree with the verb in person and/or number, and iv) a nomi- nal element in nominative that also agrees with the verb in person and/or number. In cases iiii), the two previous criteria agree- ment and governed grammeme are enough for detecting subjects and complements of the copula. However, in cases where the two elements related to the verb are nominal elements that agree with the copula and are in nominative case, as in (6), linearization helps to determine which element is the subject (i.e., the element appearing before the copula) and which one is the complement of the copula (i.e., the element appearing after the cop- ula). 6 Thus, as observed, (6a) and (6b) do not carry the same meaning: they are not exchange- able and (6b) is not the result of exchanging direc- tions over the relations of (6a). (6) Copulative: a. Poika on Hannes. boy (NOM) is Hannes (NOM) The boy is Hannes. subj copul b. Hannes on poika. Hannes (NOM) is boy (NOM) Hannes is a boy. subj copul The copul relation, thus, conveys a rigid lin- earization when combined with certain morpho- logical features, and therefore this criterion should explicitly intervene in the definition of the relation. In the same way, locative sentences containing olla require the relation adv to be right-sided (7), opposite to existential sentences, which require it to be left-sided (8). Again, this distinction only applies in cases where the non-locative element is non-definite. If it is definite (e.g., a definite mod- ifier is explicitly added), no existential interpreta- tion is possible and therefore the distinction be- tween locative and existential vanishes. 6 Even if it is possible to find sentences with the two nom- inal elements at the same side of the copula, they are not in- terpreted as neutral copulative sentences, but are communica- tively marked. (7) Locative: Pallo on p  oyd  all  a. ball (NOM) is table (ADE) The ball is on the table. subj adv (8) Existential: P  oyd  all  a on pallo. table (ADE) is ball (NOM) There is a ball on the table. adv subj obj 3 Towards a deep-syntactic annotation Since we approach linguistic description in a mul- tilayered way, our annotation scheme aims at ob- taining not only the Surface-Syntactic layer, but also a shallow semantics-oriented layer, referred to as Deep-Syntactic (DSynt) layer in the Meaning- Text Theory. An example of a DSynt structure for Finnish is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: DSyntS of the sentence Tytt  o jonka n  ain eilen ennusti, ett  a huomenna sataa vett  a. The girl whom I saw yesterday predicted that tomorrow it will rain. The main differences between a Surface- Syntactic structure (SSyntS) and a Deep-Syntactic structure (DSyntS) are the following: (i) a SSyntS contains all the words of a sen- tence, while in a DSyntS all functional ele- ments (such as governed adpositions or aux- iliaries) are removed, so that only meaning- bearing (content) elements are left; Figure 2, for instance, does not contain the subordinat- ing conjunction ett  a present in Figure 1; (ii) the SSynt tagset is language-idiosyncratic whereas in the DSyntS relations between the content elements are generic and predicate-argument oriented (thus, language- independent); for instance, subj and dobj in Figure 1 map to argumental relations in Figure 2 (respectively I and II), while relat and adv are mapped to the non-argumental relation ATTR. In other words, during the mapping between surface- and deep-syntax, functional elements and 52 predicate-argument relations have to be identi- fied. Thanks to the existence of dedicated tools such as the graph-transducer MATE (Bohnet et al., 2000), the mapping of the SSynt-annotation onto the DSynt-annotation is facilitated. For instance, Mille et al. (2013) describe how they obtain the DSynt annotation of a Spanish treebank. To make the mapping straightforward, predicate-argument information is included in the tags of surface- syntactic annotation, enriching surface-syntactic relations with semantic information. Thus, for in- stance, instead of simply annotating the relation obl obj when this relation is identified, specify- ing the argument number in the label is also re- quired: obl obj0 corresponds to the first argument, obl obj1 to the second argument, obl obj2 to the third argument, etc. Then, their mapping grammar simply converted the labels and removed func- tional elements, before removing the predicate- argument information from the superficial annota- tion. For Finnish, instead, we followed another ap- proach: we included a valency dictionary in which we store subcategorization information, i.e., the distribution of the arguments of a lemma and re- quired functional elements associated with each of the arguments 7 . For illustration, see a sample en- try of such a lexicon in Figure 3. Figure 3: Sample lexicon entry for ennustaa to predict. The entry for ennustaa to predict states that this word is a verb (PoS = V) and that it has two possible government patterns (gp): one with three arguments and one with two arguments. Consider HSY ennustaa p  oly  amisen jatkuvan HSY predicts the dust to continue for the first and Metla ennus- taa, ett  a koivu kukkii . . . Metla predicts that the birch will be in bloom . . . for the latter. Thanks to this lexicon, rules can check in the input SSyntS if a word has a dependent of the type described in its entry, and perform the adequate mapping. For instance, if a dependent of ennustaa is a noun in the nominative case with the depen- 7 As, e.g., in (Gross, 1984), and the Explanatory Combi- natorial Dictionary (Mel cuk, 1988). dency subj, the latter will be mapped to I in the DSyntS. A nominal dependent in the genitive case with a dependency dobj would be mapped to the second argument (II), while a nominalized verb in genitive receiving the dependency compl would be mapped to its third argument (III). In the lexi- con, governed conjunctions are also described, as in the description of the second argument of the second governed pattern: in this case, if ennustaa has a dependent dobj which is the conjunction ett  a, which itself introduces a finite verb, not only will dobj be mapped to second argument (II), but the governed (functional) element will be removed, so that II will link both content words of the substruc- ture, i.e., ennustaa and the dependent verb. The lexicon currently contains more than 1400 entries, including about 300 verbs, 750 nouns, 220 adjectives, 50 adverbs and 100 prepositions, post- positions and conjunctions. 8 One great advantage of this method is that this resource is not only useful for obtaining lexical valency information from syntactic structures, but also in the framework of rule-based text genera- tion, that is, for the exact opposite mapping (pro- ducing syntactic relations and functional elements from abstract predicate-argument structures (Wan- ner et al., 2014)). 9 </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Comparison with the TDT annotation scheme </heading><chunk>In this section, we present a contrastive analysis of the TDT annotation scheme, the most referenced scheme for Finnish, with respect to its treatment of certain phenomena. The last version of TDT (Haverinen et al., 2014) contains two layers of annotation. The first layer (the base-syntactic layer) contains 46 relations and 8 The lexicon furthermore contains additional information about the entries which is not related to subcategorization, such as morphological invariability, as well as the values for some lexical functions. 9 A number of other annotations have resemblance with DSyntSs; cf. (Ivanova et al., 2012) for an overview of deep dependency structures. In particular, DSyntSs show some re- semblance, but also some important differences, with Prop- Bank structures, mainly due to the fact that the latter concern phrasal chunks and not individual nodes. The degree of se- manticity of DSyntSs can be directly compared to Pragues tectogrammatical structures (Haji c et al., 2006), which con- tain autosemantic words only, leaving out synsemantic ele- ments such as determiners, auxiliaries, (all) prepositions and conjunctions. Collapsed SDs (de Marneffe et al., 2006) differ from the DSyntSs in that they collapse only (but all) preposi- tions, conjunctions and possessive clitics, they do not involve any removal of (syntactic) information, and they do not add semantic information compared to the surface annotation. 53 uses the SD scheme adapted to Finnish. The sec- ond layer inserts additional dependencies over the first layer. This second layer tries, on the one hand, to cover more semantic phenomena (con- junct propagation for coordinations, and external subjects), but, on the other hand, it aims at cov- ering some syntactic phenomenagaps resulting from the first layer annotationsuch as describing the function of relative pronouns. 10 In the following, we present the principal char- acteristics of the pure-syntactic first layer annota- tion of TDT, focusing on the most relevant dif- ferences between TDT and the annotation scheme presented in this paper. Many relations in the TDT annotation scheme are based on the PoS and internal morphological processes of the dependent and/or the governor, rather than on particu- lar syntactic properties of the relations them- selves. Even if it cannot be denied that some PoS carry restrictions that others do not, it is important to recognize when those restrictions are imposed by morpho-syntactic factors and, therefore, should not be con- fused with pure syntactic restrictions. Thus, the TDT annotation scheme distinguishes be- tween two different relations advmod and nommod for verbal modifiers (9), but the dis- tinction is based only on the PoS of the de- pendent. 11 (9) Distinguishing relations using PoS: a. The dependent is an adverb: H  an k  aveli kotiin hitaasti. He walked home slowly. advmod b. The dependent is a noun: Maljiakko oli p  oyd  all  a. The vase was on the table. nommod Not only is the PoS information duplicated in the annotation, but in those cases in which it is difficult to decide if a word is a noun or an adverb (e.g., p  a  aasiassa mainly (adverb) / main thing (noun)), if a wrong PoS tag is chosen, the annotation error directly propa- gates to the syntactic annotation, as Haveri- 10 The authors explain that this information is omitted in the first layer because of treeness restriction (Haverinen et al., 2014, p.505). 11 In this section, we have tried to use the examples pre- sented in (Haverinen, 2012), but in some cases these exam- ples have been shortened/adapted according to format restric- tions. nen et al. (2013) point out. If the syntactic behavior is not different when a dependent is an adverb or a noun, only one syntactic rela- tion should be needed. Given that the TDT tagset sub-specifies some dependency tags according to the PoS of the elements involved, it is perfectly possible to choose an annotation that links heads and dependents that belong to different clauses (without being a relative configuration), as in (10). Such analysis is not syntactically accu- rate, given that it completely ignores the syn- tactic independence of each clause. (10) Edge between independent clauses: Tulen heti, kun p  a  asen. I will come right away, when I can. advmod In contrast, we keep the syntactic indepen- dence of each clause, and relate one to each other through the relation adv (11). 12 (11) Clause independence respected: Tulen heti, kun p  a  asen. I will come right away, when I can. adv adv conj When adapting the SD scheme to Finnish, some relations in the TDT annotation were ruled out for being considered semantic in nature (Haverinen et al., 2014, p.504). Nev- ertheless, the analysis of some other phenom- ena and the consequent definition of depen- dencies related to them still has a more se- mantic justification than a syntactic one. A first example of this observation, also related to the previous point, is the division of the genitive modifiers of nouns into three differ- ent relations: poss (12a), gsubj (12b) and gobj (12c). Although it is argued that such a division responds to the desire of obtaining a higher granularity of the scheme (Haveri- nen et al., 2014, p.507), the relation division actually depends on the semantics of the gov- ernor and not on the syntactic properties of these constructions. Thus, in (12a), Matin is a genitive modifier of the noun penaali pencilcase; in (12b), due to the seman- tics of the head, maljakon vase is consid- ered a subject-like modifier of s  arkyminen 12 Another way to analyze this sentence is considering a relative configuration, the subordinating clause being a spec- ification of heti right away / this moment. 54 breaking; and in (12c), perunan potato is considered a nominal modifier of viljely growing, but it is actually analyzed as a genitive object of the verb viljell  a to grow. The annotation scheme assumes, as (12b) and (12c) show, that the nominalization process undergone by the verb makes it transmit not only its semantics, but also its syntactic prop- erties. As expected, when the annotation con- cerns genitive modifiers of nouns, the annota- tion errors propagate (Haverinen et al., 2013). (12) Distinguishing modifiers of nouns: a. Matin penaali Mattis pencilcase poss b. maljakon s  arkyminen vase (GEN) breaking gsubj c. perunan viljely potato (GEN) growing (N) gobj In the annotation schema presented in this pa- per, the three constructions are parallel and use the relation attr. Another clear example of the prevalence of semantics over syntax in TDT is the treat- ment of copular verbs. They are treated in a specific way (13), different from any other verb (14), due to the semantic link between the subject and the complement of the copu- lar verb. 13 (13) TDT analysis, copulative sentences: Huivi on punainen. the scarf (3,SG) is (3,SG) red The scarf is red. cop nsubj-cop (14) TDT analysis of non-copulative: Poika potkaisee palloa. the guy (3,SG) kicks (3,SG) the ball The guy kicks the ball. nsubj dobj 13 The TDT annotation faces a problem of not resulting in a tree when, instead of a subject noun, a participial modifier appears. Thus, in those cases, they treat a copulative configu- ration as any other verbal construction, which weakens their original analysis (Haverinen, 2012, Section 5.13). In both sentences, the verb agrees with the preverbal element in person and number, which is the morphological marker of the syntactic phenomenon of being a subject. However, the analysis assigned to each sen- tence does not capture such parallelism. The difference between both sentences concerns the second verbal complement: in copulative sentences, if its PoS licenses agreement, this element agrees with the subject in number; in non-copulative sentences, such an agreement does not happen. Therefore, two different re- lations hold between the verb and this com- plement, as (15) and (16) show. (15) Our analysis of copulative sentences: Huivi on punainen. the scarf (3,SG) is (3,SG) red The scarf is red. subj copul (16) Our analysis of non-copulative: Poika potkaisee palloa. the guy (3,SG) kicks (3,SG) the ball The guy kicks the ball. subj dobj Finally, the prevalence of semantics over syntax in TDT is exemplified through the treatment of subjects, auxiliaries and content verbs. The TDT annotation schema takes the content verb as head of the sentence, and makes the subject hold on it (17). (17) TDT treatment of auxiliaries: H  an saattoi l  ahte  a jo. he may (impf.) leave already He may have left already. aux nsubj If syntactic properties are prioritized in the course of the definition of the annotation schema, the subject relation should link the subject and the auxiliary (18), given that agreement holds between these two elements. Consequently, the auxiliary should head the relation between the two verbs. In the same way, the negative auxiliary should be also treated as the element heading the subject and the content verb. (18) Our treatment of auxiliaries: H  an saattoi l  ahte  a jo. he may (impf.) leave already He may have left already. aux subj 55 Given the semantic motivation for annotating differently similar syntactic phenomena (or vice versa), we would expect the TDT anno- tation schema to allow for a direct mapping from surface-syntax to deeper linguistic lev- els (or, in more concrete terms, to a predicate- argument structure, which we refer to as se- mantics). However, this is not the case. As detailed in Section 2.2, case markers and adpositions can be either functional or meaning-bearing, and each of them should be treated differently. TDT, however, treats as the same, on one hand, case markers and adpositions (Haverinen, 2012, p.2) and, on the other hand, elements that are purely func- tional and those ones that do convey a con- tent. The examples in (19) show TDTs parallel treatment of case markers and ad- positions (compare (19a) to (19b)), and of governed and non-governed elements (com- pare (19b) to (19c)). As can be observed, the same syntactic analysis is offered to sen- tences that differ in syntax: in (19a), the adessive case of p  oyt  a table is required for expressing a locative meaning with the verb olla, whereas in (19b), the genitive case is required by the adposition and not by the verb or the configuration itself. On the other hand, non-governed elements (such as p  a  all  a on top of in (19b)) are treated in the same way as governed elements (such as kanssa with in (19c)). (19) TDT treatment of adpositions: a. Maljiakko oli p  oyd  all  a. The vase was on the table nommod b. Maljiakko oli p  oyd  an p  a  all  a. The vase was table on top of nommod adpos c. HY tekee yhteisty  ot  a Aalto-yliopiston kanssa. U.H. collaborates U.Aalto. with subj nommod adpos One problem of treating functional and con- tent elements in the same way is the difficulty in reaching an actual abstract structure which contains only content words. (20) is an ex- pansion of (19c) where, apart from the gov- erned adposition, there is a translative case (-ksi), expressing purpose, which is not re- quired by the predicate. In an abstract struc- ture corresponding to (20), the governed ad- position should not appear, unlike the non- governed case.

The university of Helsinky collaborated with the University Aalto to promote a new way of digital learning. Another example of the difficulty of getting an appropriate mapping between syntax and semantics is the treatment of relative pro- nouns: in the first layer of annotation, all rel- ative pronouns receive the same relation from the subordinate verb (i.e., rel), without taking into account the syntactic function of the pro- noun within the subordinate clause (21). (21) TDT treatment of relative pronouns: a. auto, joka ohitti meid  at the car that (NOM) passed us rcmod rel b. mies, jonka n  ain eilen the man that (GEN) I saw yesterday rcmod rel Even though a case can indicate the func- tion occupied by the element to which it is attached, it is not enough for obtaining a di- rect mapping to semantics. First of all, many times, cases themselves are not enough for indicating such function, but their combin- ability with the involved verbs is also needed. Secondly, and more importantly, the same cases are used by elements that occupy dif- ferent semantic slots. Thus, for instance, both subjects and objects accept the same set of cases (nominative, partitive and gen- itive), which clearly blurs a direct mapping to predicate-argument structures. In our syn- tactic annotation scheme, rel would be anno- tated as a subject in (21a), and as object in in (21b). </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Conclusions </heading><chunk>In this paper, we presented an annotation schema for Finnish that can be considered an alternative 56 to the SD-oriented schema used in the TDT tree- bank. We justify and present a syntactically moti- vated tagset for Finnish, and the creation of a lexi- con which facilitates the annotation of a deep syn- tactic (semantics-oriented) representation which captures lexical valency relations between con- tent lexical items. Having two distinct levels for capturing syntactic and semantic information, has been shown to allow for developing different NLP applications in the parsing and the natural lan- guage generation fields (Ballesteros et al., 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2015). The corpus annotated following the SSynt and DSynt annotation schemata described in this paper are made available upon request. </chunk></section><section><heading>Acknowledgements </heading><chunk>The work described in this paper has been carried out in the framework of the project Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and Deliv- ery Orchestration (PESCaDO), supported by the European Commission under the contract number FP7-ICT-248594. </chunk></section><section><heading>References </heading><chunk>M.
