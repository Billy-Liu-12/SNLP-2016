We received 35 paper submissions, of which 22 were chosen for oral presentation and one was a system demonstration; all 23 papers are included in this volume. This workshop was intended to bring researchers from all areas of speech and language tech- nology with a common interest in making everyday life more accessible for people with phys- ical, cognitive, sensory, emotional or developmental disabilities. This workshop builds on five previous such workshops (co-located with conferences such as ACL, NAACL, EMNLP and Interspeech); it provides an opportunity for individuals from research communities, and the individuals with whom they are working, to share research findings, and to discuss present and future challenges and the potential for collaboration and progress. While Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a particularly apt application area for speech and natural language processing technologies, we purposefully made the scope of the workshop broad enough to include assistive technologies (AT) as a whole, even those falling outside of AAC. Thus we have aimed at broad inclusivity, which is also manifest in the diversity of our Program Committee. We are also very delighted to have Prof. Jonas Beskow from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, as invited speaker. The success of this SLPAT 2015 edition was due to the authors who submitted such interesting and diverse work and which generated so intense discussions. Finally, we must thank all the people who made this event possible: The members of the Program Committee for completing their reviews promptly, and for providing useful feedback for deciding on the program and preparing the final versions of the papers. The Interspeech organisers who, in many ways, made the organisation easier, the ISCA Administrative Secretariat for handling finance and the Dresden University of Technology which hosted the event in their premises.
