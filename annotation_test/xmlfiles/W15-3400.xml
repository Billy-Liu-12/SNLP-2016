This definition includes many types of parallel and non-parallel multilingual corpora, but also sets of monolingual corpora that are used for comparative purposes. Research on comparable corpora is active but used to be scattered among many workshops and conferences. The workshop series on Building and Using Comparable Corpora (BUCC) aims at promoting progress in this exciting emerging field by bundling its research, thereby making it more visible and giving it a better platform. Research on comparable corpora spans a number of topics from machine translation to contrastive linguistics. Distributional analysis, a topic which has seen renewed interest in recent years, has formed the core of a large part of the methods used to identify translations in comparable corpora. As a matter of fact, the standard techniques of word alignment in comparable corpora can be seen as methods for cross-language distributional semantics. Following the seven previous editions of the workshop which took place at LREC 2008 (Marrakech), ACL-IJCNLP 2009 (Singapore), LREC 2010 (Malta), ACL-HLT 2011 (Portland), LREC 2012 (Istanbul), ACL 2013 (Sofia), LREC 2014 (Reykjavik), the workshop this year is co-located with ACL- IJCNLP 2015 in Beijing, China. This years workshop also hosts a companion shared task which is the first evaluation exercise on the identification of comparable texts: given a large multilingual collection of texts derived from Wikipedia, detecting the most similar texts across languages. Evaluation is performed using a gold standard based on actual inter-language links. Three teams submitted eleven runs to link text in three languages to comparable English texts. A special section in this proceedings volume reports on this shared task. Finally, we would like to thank all people who in one way or another helped in making this workshop once again a success. Our special thanks go to Benjamin K. Tsou for accepting to give the invited presentation, to the members of the program committee who did an excellent job in reviewing the submitted papers, and to the ACL-IJCNLP 2015 workshop chairs and organizers. We also thank LIMSI- CNRS for financial support to our invited speaker. Last but not least we would like to thank our authors and the participants of the workshop.
