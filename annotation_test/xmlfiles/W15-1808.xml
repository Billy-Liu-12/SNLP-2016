An approach based on syntac- tic analysis designed for multiword term lemmatisation was adapted for a broader range of MWEs taken from the Dictionary of Lithuanian Nominal Phrases. In the present analysis, the main lemmatisation errors are identified and some improve- ments are proposed. It shows that auto- matic lemmatisation can be improved by taking into account the whole set of gram- matical forms for each MWE. It would allow selecting the optimal grammatical form for lemmatisation and identifying some grammatical restrictions. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>In Lithuanian, in addition to fully fixed multiword expressions (MWEs), there are many MWEs with one or more constituents (possibly all) which can be inflected. Therefore, these flexible MWEs appear in texts in several forms 1 : as shown by the corpus data, the Lithuanian verbal phraseme pak- isti koj a, meaning to put a spoke in somebodys wheel, has a form with the verb in definite past pakiso koj a, a form with the verb in past frequen- tative (pakisdavo koj a), and future (pakis koj a) (for more examples, see Kovalevskait  e (2014)). If we extract MWEs of a strongly-inflected language like Lithuanian from a raw text corpus using sta- tistical association measures, we often get MWEs with their different grammatical forms (GF). How- ever, in lexical databases and terminology banks, a single lemma is usually used in order to represent the MWE independently from its concrete forms which appear in the corpus. 1 Grammatical forms of the same MWE (or phraseme) can be labelled as phraseme-types (Kovalevskait  e, 2014). In traditional Lithuanian dictionaries of idioms, there is no problem of MWE lemmatisation, be- cause data are collected manually and represented following the rule that a verb of an idiom is pro- vided in infinitive form (Paulauskas (ed), 2001), e.g.: Savo viet a zinoti to know ones place, Vie- tos netur  eti to have nowhere to go. The re- cent Dictionary of Lithuanian Nominal Phrases 2 , which was compiled semi-automatically from a corpus, contains the unlemmatised list of MWEs. Therefore, automatic phrase lemmatisation could help in organizing the dictionary data and in im- proving the user interface. This article describes the main problems oc- curring during the lemmatisation of Lithuanian MWEs. The concept of lemmatisation is quite clear for single words, but for MWEs, it can be un- derstood differently as it will be discussed in part 3. Although the accuracy of lemmatisation of in- dividual words is high (99% for lemmatisation and 94% for grammatical form identification (Rimkut  e and Daudaravi cius, 2007)), the lemmatisation of single words included in MWEs cannot produce well-formed MWE lemmas. Indeed, base forms of Lithuanian multiword terms which should oc- cur in dictionaries and terminology databases are not the same as the sequences of lemmas of their constitutive words (Boizou et al., 2012, p. 28). For example, if we lemmatise each constitutive word in MWEs taupom uj u bank u, taupomuoju banku (savings bank in genitive plural and instrumen- tal singular), the result is taupyti bankas (infini- tive to save and nominative singular bank), be- cause the morphological annotator of the Lithua- nian language (Zinkevi cius, 2000; Zinkevi cius et al., 2005) assignes infinitive as the proper lemma for participles and other verb forms. The struc- ture of such improperly lemmatised MWE fails to reflect the syntactic relations (agreement and gov- 2 http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/lkk/pdf/dikt_fr.pdf Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 41 ernment) which ensure the grammatical cohesion between the constitutive words of an MWE. This work is focused on syntagmatic lemma, which is the form of the MWE where the MWE syntactic head is lemmatised and the necessary adaptations are made in order to ensure the mor- phosyntactic unity of the MWE. With a similar approach, a tool for automatic Lithuanian sintag- matic lemmatisation called JungLe was first de- veloped and trained with multiword terms during the project SIMTAI 2 (semi-automatic extraction of education and science terms). The first ex- periments with the Lithuanian multiword terms showed accuracy close to 95% (Boizou et al., 2012), but it can be related to a relatively low vari- ety of term structures. For this study, JungLe was adapted for a broader set of types of Lithuanian compositional and non-compositional MWEs, e.g. idioms, collocations, nominal compounds, MW terms, MW named entities, MW function words, proverbs, etc. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Data </heading><chunk>This study is based on the data from the Dictionary of Lithuanian Nominal Phrases (further on, dictio- nary). The database of the dictionary 3 consists of 68,602 nominal phrases. It has to be mentioned, that the term nominal phrase refers to all MWEs which contain at least one noun: it can be phrases with a noun as a syntactic head, as well as phrases with a verb or an adjective as a syntactic head. In this article, the terms MWE and phrase are used interchangeably. In the dictionary, the phrases are of different length: from two-word phrases (31,853 phrases) to phrases comprising 46 words (1 phrase). The major part of the dictionary phrases is made up of two-word phrases (46.4%), whereas three-word phrases and four-word phrases form accordingly 28.7% and 10.1% of the dictionary (Rimkut  e et al., 2012, p. 19). The phrases are not lemmatised, but given in the form as they appear in the corpus, e.g.: mobilaus rysio telefonas, mobilaus rysio tele- fono, mobilaus rysio telefon a, mobilaus rysio telefonus (mobile phone in various gram- matical forms: nominative singular, genitive singular, accusative singular and accusative plural); 3 http://tekstynas.vdu.lt/page.xhtml?id=dictionary-db nenuleisti rank u, nenuleido rank u, nenulei- dzia rank u (not to give up, lit. not to lower hands, in various grammatical forms: infini- tive, definite past, present tense). As Lithuanian is a strongly inflected language, it is an advantage that users can see phrases in the form they are used in the corpus. Phrases were ex- tracted by the method of Gravity Counts (Dauda- ravi cius and Marcinkevi cien  e, 2004, p. 330) from the Corpus of Contemporary Lithuanian Language (100 m running words; made up of periodicals, fiction, non-fiction, and legal texts published in 1991-2002). Gravity Counts helps to evaluate the combinability of two words according to in- dividual word frequencies, pair frequencies or the number of different words in a selected 3 word- span. As a result, it detects collocational chains as text fragments, not as a list of collocates for the previously selected node-words. After automatic extraction of collocational chains from the corpus, manual procedures were performed: transformation of collocational chains into phrases (the procedure is described in de- tail in Marcinkevi cien  e (2010) and Rimkut  e et al. (2012)). According to the lexicographical ap- proach, linguistically well-formed collocational chains have to be grammatical, meaningful, and arbitrary. Therefore, some chains were shortened, complemented, joined or deleted manually. At present, the dictionary database contains phrases without additions (1) and with additions: additions can be explicitly specified (2) or not (3), e.g.: 1. ne tuo adresu under a wrong address; 2. (gauti; suteikti) daugiau informacijos (get; give) more information; 3. atkreipiant d  emes  i i (. . . ) paying attention to (. . . ). Phrase Number of Number of lemmas type lemmas with 2 or more GF 2-word 18,581 6,585 (35,4%) 3-word 10,970 2,245 (20,5%) 4-word 3,333 477 (14,3%) In total 32,884 9,307 (28,3%) Table 1: Statistical information about MWEs from the type (1). Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 42 Only two-, three-, and four-word phrases from the type (1) were filtered out for this study (see Table 1). As already mentioned, these phrases make up 85% of the whole dictionary database, and thus can be considered as the most typical multiword units in Lithuanian (Marcinkevi cien  e, 2010; Rimkut  e et al., 2012). Most of them are id- ioms, phraseologisms and collocations, although there are many multiword terms as well. It was calculated that two-word expressions have on average 1.71 different grammatical forms, three-word expressions around 1.35 different grammatical forms, and four-word expressions 1.22 different grammatical forms. The maximum number of grammatical forms for one lemma are respectively 21 (auksta mokykla high school), 15 (mobilaus rysio telefonas mobile phone) and 8 (kandidatas i seimo narius candidate as MP). For this study, only the 9,307 MWEs with two or more grammatical forms were selected. The remaining MWEs, those for which only one form was iden- tified automatically, are excluded, as they do not always need to be lemmatised and require a fur- ther study. The next section describes the main approaches applied to the process of automatic lemmatisation of MWEs. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Approaches to Lemmatisation of MWEs </heading><chunk>In Lithuanian, a great number of MWEs can ap- pear in different grammatical forms. As such, they do not differ from variable simple words. Accord- ingly, a lot of Lithuanian MWEs consist of nouns, verbs and/or adjectives that are used in a particular grammatical form. Some of these word classes can have from a few to dozens of different grammati- cal forms. Traditionally, for the set of grammati- cal forms of each variable word, one basic form is assigned. The latter, a lemma, is a convenient rep- resentation of the whole set of grammatical word forms. Although in principle a lemma could be an artificial form (a stem, for example), the tradition is to select as a lemma one form from the whole set of grammatical forms, e.g. in Lithuanian: nominative singular form for nouns (except for plural nouns); nominative singular masculine positive in- definite form for adjectives; positive form for adverbs (if they vary in de- gree); infinitive for verbs (including participles). In the field of computational linguistics, it is common to use artificial lemmas for MWEs, be- cause they can be easily generated by automatic means. There are two main kinds of artificial lem- mas: a) It is possible to use a lemmatic sequence which is the sequence of lemmas of each con- stitutive word of the MWE 4 . Using the morpho- logical annotation tool for Lithuanian (the tool is described in Zinkevi cius (2000) and Zinke- vi cius et al. (2005)), each grammatical form of the multiword term, bendrosioms mokslo programoms framework programme, is annotated morpholog- ically as follows: &lt;word="bendrosioms" lemma="bendras" type="bdv., teig, nelygin. l., ivardz., mot. g., dgs., N."/&gt; 5 &lt;word="mokslo" lemma="mokslas" type= "dkt., vyr. g., vns., K."/&gt; 6 &lt;word="programoms" lemma="programa" type="dkt., mot. g., dgs., N."/&gt; 7 The lemmatic sequence, e.g. for the previous example bendras mokslas programa, is often used in the field of automatic term recognition (e.g., Loginova et al. (2012, p. 9)) to represent a term or another type of MWE. Nonetheless, such a substi- tute, which lacks grammatical cohesion between the parts of the MWE, appears as a heap of words, which is unnatural for human users 8 . 4 The difference between syntagmatic lemma (with mor- phosyntactic relations between constitutive words) and lem- matic sequence (the sequence of lemmas of constitutive words) is relevant only for MWEs, not for single words. 5 The field type contains the following grammatical fea- tures: adjective, positive, undefined, positive degree, femi- nine, plural, dative. 6 Grammatical features: noun, masculine, singular, geni- tive. 7 Grammatical features: noun, feminine, plural, dative. 8 In about 5% of the studied phrases, the sequences of iso- lated lemmas incidentally correspond to their natural lemma, e.g. vyras ir moteris man and woman, valstybinis simfoni- nis orkestras national symphony orchestra. Such cases re- quire the following conditions: the nominal syntactic head is masculine singular, the only syntactic relation inside the term is agreement or implies invariable words, degree and defi- niteness must not be retained in the lemma, no participle is implied. Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 43 b) The second frequent method is stemming, that is, dropping of endings. For example, the forms of the previously mentioned MWE bendroji mokslo programa, bendrosios mokslo programos and bendrosioms mokslo programoms can be rep- resented as: bendr moksl program. This option is even more artificial for Lithuanian, since, in addi- tion to the loss of syntactic cohesion, this approach generates shortened words without endings, which do not exist in Lithuanian. Other approaches attempt to provide a natural lemma, i.e., by either choosing the most frequent form as a lemma, or generating a correct syntag- matic lemma from grammatical forms. Taking the most frequent form of the lemma avoids mistakes in generation, but the result is that the set of ba- sic forms is heterogeneous: some MWEs will be in nominative, some will be in accusative, genitive or in some other case, some will be in the plural form, others - in the singular. Automatic lemmatisation according to the syn- tactic structure of each MWE ensures the con- stitency of basic forms, but it is the most com- plicated process. The tool JungLe, which is de- scribed in Boizou et al. (2012), was specifically designed for this task. This software analyses an MWE and attempts to distinguish three types of syntactic components (as a concrete example the multiword term individualus studij u grafikas in- dividual study plan/schedule is provided): syntactic head (e.g., the noun grafikas plan/schedule); words congruent with the head (e.g., the ad- jective individualus individual); other words, that is, words governed by the head and their own dependents (e.g., the noun in genitive case studij u study). The generation of the syntagmatic lemma re- quires the syntactic head to be lemmatised (for terms, the syntactic head is a noun, but there is more diversity with other types of MWEs). Words (usually in the genitive case) governed by the head and their own dependents remain in their gram- matical form, e.g., svietimo {lygmuo} education level, socialini u moksl u {sritis} field of social sciences. 9 9 Here and below the syntactic head is indicated in curly brackets. The most difficult case concerns words congru- ent with the head, since they often have to be cor- rected to remain congruent with the head once it is lemmatised. If the head is masculine singular, the adaptation usually requires only taking lem- mas for each congruent word, e.g., in the mul- tiword term individualus studij u grafikas indivi- dual study plan/schedule (the adjective individ- ualus individual agrees with the noun grafikas schedule, not with the noun studij u study). When the syntactic head is feminine, congruent words must also be put in their feminine form, e.g., nuotolin  es studijos distance studies (instead of *nuotolinis studijos, where the masculine singular indefinite positive form of the adjective nuotolinis is incongruent with the feminine plural head studi- jos). Besides, some lexico-grammatical features, e.g., definiteness, comparative/superlative de- grees, are usually semantically relevant, so that they have to be kept in the syntagmatic lemma, which requires to generate the proper form, even when the head is masculine and singular, e.g. Senasis ir Naujasis testamentas The Old and New Testament (where the adjectives Senasis and Naujasis are in the definite form, instead of *Senas ir Naujas testamentas), aukstesnioji zem  es ukio mokykla high school of agriculture (where the adjective aukstesnioji is in the definite com- parative form, instead of *aukstas zem  es ukio mokykla). Syntagmatic lemmatisation also requires to lemmatise participles in a different manner than single words. Indeed, participles are traditionally lemmatised as verbs in infinitive form. For ex- ample, the single word lemmatisation of the term perkeliamieji geb  ejimai transferable skills gives a result perkelti geb  ejimai, that is a sequence of an infinitive (perkelti to transfer) and a noun in nominative (geb  ejimai skills). The correct syn- tagmatic lemmatisation requires participles to be corrected in gender, number and case only, in or- der to remain congruent with their lemmatised head, e.g. perkeliamasis geb  ejimas. All required generations are made by a light- weighted generative module. This module uses to the largest possible extent the information pro- vided by the morphological analyser, which works on a single word basis. Its generative capacities are restricted to the nominative forms, since noun, adjective and participle lemmas are in the nomina- Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 44 tive form. Aiming at facilitation of the process, the generation proceeds either from a single lemma or a grammatical form. For example, lemmas for par- ticiples are generated from the grammatical form, because it helps to avoid the problem of numer- ous verbal paradigms in Lithuanian, while adjec- tives are generated from the lemma. Indeed, some endings of nouns and adjectives (e.g., -(i) u geni- tive plural) hide the declension paradigm (which is necessary for the selection of the correct fem- inine ending), so that it is better to decide from the lemma, which expresses the adjectival declen- sion paradigm by its ending 10 , e.g., nuotolinis distant (third adjectival declension paradigm) nuotolin  e. The whole process is very similar to Thurmair (2012, p. 257). </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Syntagmatic Lemmatisation of Lithuanian MWEs: Evaluation and Results </heading><chunk>In this part of the article, we present our results: what problems are solved by syntactic analysis, and what problems still remain and pose chal- lenges for automatic MWE lemmatisation. Two-, three- and four-word phrases were au- tomatically lemmatised with the help of Jun- gLe tool and the results were evaluated manu- ally (see Table 2). JungLe generates a lemma for each MWE grammatical form separately, so that more than one lemma can be provided for the same MWE, especially when it is difficult to identify automatically to which word an attribute in genitive belongs, e.g., two lemmas, both in- accurate, were provided for the MWE bendroji dalin  es nuosavyb  es teis  e general partial owner- ship, where the first adjective bendroji general is congruent with the MWE head teis  e law and the second adjective dalin  es partial with the noun nuosavyb  es property (which depends on the MWE head). In the first provided lemma *ben- droji dalin  e nuosavyb  es teis  e, dalin  e incorrectly agrees with teis  e, and in the second one, *ben- drosios dalin  es nuosavyb  es teis  e, bendrosios in- correctly agrees with nuosavyb  es. As each grammatical form is lemmatised sepa- rately, in some cases there is more than one lemma for the same MWE. Thus, lemmatisation accuracy was assessed for individual grammatical forms of 10 Ending -as for the first adjectival declension, -ias for the second, -is and -ys for the third and fourth, and -us for the fifth. MWEs. Table 2 shows that the highest accuracy is with two-word phrases; however, the number of incorrectly lemmatised MWEs increases for three- and four-word phrases. It shows that the syn- tactic complexity increases with the length of the MWEs. Phrase Number of Number Correctly type lemmas of GF lemmatised GF 2-word 6,585 19,822 91.56% 3-word 2,245 6,110 80.57% 4-word 477 1,206 76.43% In total 9,307 27,138 Table 2: Statistical information about the analysed MWEs (2 or more forms only). The analysis of the automatic lemmatisation revealed three groups of errors 11 : a) agreement errors (number, gender); b) government errors; c) lexico-grammatical errors (degree, definiteness, lexical plural). </chunk></section><section><heading>4.1 Agreement Errors </heading><chunk>Many errors occur with numerals, e.g., *beveik du tre cdalis *nearly two third (it should be beveik du tre cdaliai, nearly two thirds, with tre c- dalis third in the plural form), also *astuoni m  enuo *eight month (while it should be astuoni m  enesiai, eight months, with m  enuo month in the plural form). Many of these errors can be elim- inated by applying proper rules in the syntactic analysis. During the syntactic analysis gender errors oc- cur when the composition of an MWE is more complex, e.g., *vienas ar kita grup  e one or the other group(instead of viena ar kita grup  e, with viena one and kita other in the feminine form). We can see that the coordinating link could be the factor determining the agreement errors 12 . 11 Some errors of lemmatisation occur due to errors of the previous morphological analysis, e.g., the lemma for the MWE arbatinio saukstelio (tea spoon, sing. Gen.) is pro- vided incorrectly as *arbatinio saukstelis (genitive singular + nominative singular, instead of arbatinis saukstelis, nomina- tive singular for both the adjective and the noun), because of an improper morphological analysis: arbatinis was annotated as a noun, not an adjective. 12 Some similar errors, which must be corrected, appear with the genitive case, e.g. Afrikos ir Azija (genitive and nom- inative, it should be Afrika ir Azija Africa and Asia, nomina- tive and nominative), *daina ir soki u ansamblis (nominative noun, conjunction, genitive noun, nominative noun), instead of dain u ir soki u {ansamblis} (genitive noun, conjunction, genitive noun, nominative noun) song and dance ensemble. Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 45 It was observed that a large number of agree- ment errors take place when one of the attributes is an apposition, i.e., a noun which has to agree in a case (sometimes gender and number) with the ad- jacent noun, e.g., *salies gav  eja (it should be salis gav  eja, the recipient party), *mergel  es Marija (it should be mergel  e Marija, the Virgin Mary, with both parts in nominative). One the other hand, such attributes are not numerous, and such errors could be solved by looking at other cases than gen- itive. </chunk></section><section><heading>4.2 Government Errors </heading><chunk>Problems mainly arise when the tool fails to cor- rectly identify the syntactic head of a phrase. Such a problem usually occurs when the head is not at the end of an MWE, e.g. *paskolos {studijos} (in- stead of {paskola} studijoms study loan), *atliko savo {darbas} carried out their work (instead of {atlikti} savo darb a, where the verb is the head). Problems also occur in phrases, where the head is a half-participle or a gerund: *  isigaliojus nauja- sis civilinis {kodeksas} when the new civil code came into effect (it should be {  isigaliojus} nau- jajam civiliniam kodeksui, i.e. where dative is re- quired). It must be noticed that in some cases the rep- resentation of the lemma does not correspond to a natural linguistic form. It occurs in colloca- tions which contain a conjugated verb (pakilo) with a (nominative) subject, e.g. pakilo tem- perat  ura temperature rised. In the assigned lem- mas, conjugated verbs are substituted for infinitive forms (pakilti). Infinitives cannot have a subject in Lithuanian, and therefore the MWE subject could be presented in brackets in the nominative form (e.g. pakilti (temperat  ura) to rise (temperature)). A further exception comes from the MWEs with a gerund, since the logical subject of a gerund is not expressed as a nominative, but as a dative comple- ment, e.g., atsitikus nelaimei a disaster occurs. In such cases, we propose to assign two differ- ent lemmas: one lemma, which retains the gram- matical form without change, atsitikus nelaimei (gerund + dative complement), as used in gerund grammatical form; and the second lemma, where the gerund is substituted for the infinitive and the dative complement is substituted for a nominative form in bracket, e.g. atsitikti (nelaim  e) (infinitive + nominative), as in the previous example. We should also mention, among other compli- cated lemmatisation instances, the loss of gram- matical forms which carry the meaning of an MWE, e.g., atstov u teigimas (representatives as- sertion) could be considered as a correctly gen- erated lemma; however, after a closer investiga- tion of the grammatical forms, we can see that in this MWE the syntactic head is always used in the instrumental case (teigimu), i.e., atstov u teigimu (according to the representatives), thus the lemma should keep this form. Similarly, the lemma of an MWE balsavimo pastas (voting post) is not accurate, as the syntactic head (pas- tas) should be in the instrumental case, i.e., bal- savimas pastu (voting by mail), while the lemma of a phrase visa isgal  e (all possible measures) should be visomis isgal  emis (by all possible mea- sures), because this phrase as an MWE is used only in the form of instrumental plural. </chunk></section><section><heading>4.3 Lexico-grammatical Errors </heading><chunk>There are many errors made by JungLe where a lemma has to be assigned to nouns which are used in plural in the phrase, e.g., *zmogaus teis  e ir laisv  e human right and freedom, instead of zmogaus teis  es ir laisv  es, human rights and free- doms; *jungtin  e tauta united nation, instead of Jungtin  es Tautos, United Nations; *visa Baltijos salis the whole Baltic country, instead of visos Baltijos salys all Baltic countries, *Vilniaus ir Sal cinink u rajonas Vilnius and Sal cininkai dis- trict, instead of Vilniaus ir Sal cinink u rajonai Vilnius and Sal cininkai districts. As number er- rors were considered the examples when a lemma looked correct at first sight, i.e., a lemma is pro- vided in the same number as in the dictionary. However, from the usage data (all forms of a phrase) one can see that certain MWEs are used only in plural, e.g., meteorologin  es s alygos me- teorological conditions, mineralin  es tr asos min- eral fertilizers, mirties aplinkyb  es death circum- stances. All these phrases, which are made of an adjective or a genitive noun followed by a noun, are incorrectly lemmatised in the singular form, e.g. *meteorologin  e s alyga, *mineralin  e tr asa, *mirties aplinkyb  e. Many of the above-mentioned nouns can be used in plural and singular, when they are used independently, but they can be re- stricted to one of these numbers inside MWEs. Traditional grammars and dictionaries do not pro- vide necessary information to solve this problem, which could often be resolved if we take into ac- Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 46 count actual usage from the corpus. There are two types of degree errors: a) in some phrases a particular degree form is used, thus, the same form should be in the lemma (Auks ciausia- sis Teismas supreme court; daugiau kaip dveji metai more than two years); b) there are phrases, where an adverb or an adjective is used in several degrees: then different phrases can contain adjec- tives or adverbs of different degrees (cf. ivair  us / ivairiausi b  udai (various/ the most various ways) and skirti daug/daugiau/daugiausia d  emesio (to pay a lot of/more/ most attention)). Analysis of all forms of an MWE can help to distinguish a) and b) phrases. Errors of definiteness often occur in phrases joined by coordination, when one adjective is pro- vided in the definite form while the other one is in- definite, e.g., *Senas ir Naujasis testamentas (Old and New Testament). After the examination of errors and problem- atic cases created by JungLe, we can draw a con- clusion that automatic lemmatisation is aggravated by: 1. syntactic heads in the genitive form: when there are several nouns in the genitive in the MWE, it leads to attachment ambiguities; 2. the length of an MWE: the longer the phrase, the more complicated syntactic structure; the accuracy of lemmatisation decreases (see Ta- ble 2); 3. problems of lexico-grammatical nature, when a grammatical form depends on a lexical meaning (here, errors of number must be em- phasized). It must be emphasized that the numbers in Ta- ble 2 show the situation after the first extension of JungLe. The results can still be improved signifi- cantly. Some errors can be corrected by improving the grammar used by JungLe for syntactic analy- sis, some of them require adding new capacities to JungLe, other errors will be difficult to correct without human intervention. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Discussion and Recommendations </heading><chunk>The traditional morphological analyser, which analyses every word individually, cannot produce natural lemmas for MWEs. It is necessary to carry out the syntactic analysis for automatic assigna- tion of natural lemmas for different grammatical forms of MWEs. But beside syntactic analysis of MWEs, we often need to take into account the us- age data of a particular MWE and to apply addi- tional criteria. The automatic syntagmatic lemma- tisation tool was tested on the data from the Dic- tionary of Lithuanian Nominal Phrases, which are characterized by a high variety. For this reason, it can be stated that the essential features, as well as problems, of automatic lemmatisation of Lithua- nian MWEs were identified. One of the most important lemmatisation is- sues that is difficult to solve is the problem of an attribute which is incongruent with a noun and usually expressed in genitive. Most com- monly, such problems (in automatic lemmatisa- tion) are inevitable, because ambivalent syntac- tic relations can exist in MWEs composed of the same words, e.g., the lemma for MWE gram- matical forms administracin  es teis  es pazeidim u, administracin  es teis  es pazeidim a, administracin  es teis  es pazeidimus breach of administrative law (where administracinis administrative is con- gruent with teis  e law) should be adminis- tracin  es teis  es pazeidimas, while the lemma for MWE grammatical forms administracin  i teis  es pazeidim a, administracini u teis  es pazeidim u, ad- ministracinius teis  es pazeidimus administrative breach of law (where administracinis adminis- trative is congruent with pazeidimas breach) should be administracinis teis  es pazeidimas. In order to set the right lemma, the noun with which the adjective agrees must be correctly assigned. The head of a phrase in genitive can influence adjective agreement errors, too. For instance, the genitive grammatical form periodinio mokslo lei- dinio, where it is unclear if periodinio periodic is congruent with mokslo science or leidinio pub- lication, could formally be lemmatised as *pe- riodinio mokslo leidinys a publication of peri- odic science or periodinis mokslo leidinys a pe- riodic scientific publication by looking at the in- ternal syntactic structure of the term. In order to disambiguate syntax correctly, we need to com- pare other (unambiguous, i.e., cases other than the genitive) forms of the term, e.g., periodiniams mokslo leidiniams (in dative plural), which shows that the adjective periodinis periodic is congru- ent with the noun leidinys publication, therefore, this MWE should properly be lemmatised as peri- odinis mokslo leidinys. The problems concerning the genitive case Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 47 would decrease, if the usage criterion was applied, i.e., if lemma was identified considering all forms of the MWE. For example, it is especially com- plicated to lemmatise an MWE with all genitive cases, e.g., it is impossible to identify an accurate lemma for MWEs valstybinio socialinio draudimo biudzeto (the budget of state social insurance), fizini u asmen u pajam u mokes ci u (income taxes of natural persons). In such cases, a rule should be applied: if the same phrase is used in genitive and in other cases, the lemma should be identified on the basis of phrases with other cases than genitive. The usage criterion would help to avoid the number errors. Quite often this criterion proved the rule that if different grammatical forms of an MWE are in plural, then the lemma should keep the plural form too. For example, a dictio- nary of nominal phrases provides two grammatical forms: lauzas ir atliekos, lauzo ir atliek u debris and waste, in both phrases the noun lauzas is in the singular form, while atliekos is used in plural. Thus, when merging the two MWEs to one lemma, atliekos has to remain in the plural form. During the lemmatisation of the forms zv  eris ir pauks cius, zv  eri u ir pauks ci u, zv  erys ir pauks ciai (beasts and birds, repectively accusative plural, genitive plu- ral, nominative plural), we have to assign plural lemmas for both nouns zv  erys ir pauks ciai, be- cause all forms of these nominal phrases are in the plural form. This is especially important for names, cf. *Lietuvos gelezinkelis (it should be Li- etuvos gelezinkeliai, Lithuanian Railways), *Vil- niaus silumos tinklas (it should be Vilniaus silu- mos tinklai, Vilnius Heating Network). Based on the usage data, it would be possible to distinguish between the MWEs where a certain word is used only in one form of the degree (Auks- ciausiasis Teismas, superlative, Supreme Court), and those where several forms of a degree are used (  ivair  us b  udai and ivairiausi b  udai, positive and superlative, various ways). When applying the usage criterion, it is impor- tant to remember that in this case the accuracy of the tool will be linked to the corpus data: the rarer the phrase, the higher the risk for the tool to make a mistake. For example, if we recognize only two forms of a particular phrase, and they are both in the plural form, the tool can come to a false con- clusion that the lemma of that phrase is also in plu- ral, although that phrase could also be used in sin- gular. But such a risk is significant for rare MWEs only. It is possible that next to the usage criterion, other criteria will have to be introduced. For ex- ample, in order to avoid lemmatisation errors re- lated to definiteness, it would be worthwhile to in- voke not only the usage, but, also, frequency cri- terion. Indeed, according to the data, nekilnoja- mas turtas (with the indefinite form of the adjec- tive nekilnojamas) and nekilnojamasis turtas (with the definite form of the adjective nekilnojamasis), which both mean real property, are concurrently used. However, one can expect the standard form, the definite one, to be more frequent, as it is a term. The evaluation of the research results has re- vealed that the accuracy of the MWE lemma- tisation is not only influenced by the accuracy of the syntactic analyser, but, also, by the vari- ability of MWEs. If we come across a phrase which has two variants, then a separate lemma will be assigned to each variant during the au- tomatic lemmatisation, e.g., uzras u knygut  e and uzras u knygel  e (a notebook, the difference lies in the diminutive suffix of the nouns). However, several forms of degree, different forms of defi- niteness could be used in the same MWE; for this reason, we have to discuss how to reflect all this in a lemma. The substituting component could be presented in angle brackets: skirti [daug/daugiau] d  emesio to pay [much/more] attention; [nekilno- jamas/nekilnojamasis] turtas real property (with a definite or indefinite adjective). Thus, this would indicate that some syntagmatic lemmas contain substituting components. </chunk></section><section><heading>References </heading><chunk>Loic Boizou, Gintar  e Grigonyt  e, Erika Rimkut  e, and Andrius Utka. 2012.
