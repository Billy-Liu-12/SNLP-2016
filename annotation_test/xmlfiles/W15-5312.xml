Remarkable Similarity of Clausal Coordinate Ellipsis in Russian Compared to Dutch, Estonian, German, and Hungarian Karin Harbusch and Denis Krusko Computer Science Department University of KoblenzLandau, Koblenz, Germany harbusch, kruskod@uni-koblenz.de Abstract Elliptical constructions can help to avoid repetition of identical constituents during natural-language generation. From gram- mar books, it is not easy to extract exe- cutable rules for ellipsisin our case in Russian. Therefore we follow a differ- ent strategy. We test the accuracy of a rule set that has been evaluated for the two Germanic languages, Dutch and German, and the two Finno-Ugric languages, Esto- nian and Hungarian. For a Russian test corpus of about 100 syntactically anno- tated coordinated sentences that systemat- ically vary the conditions of rule applica- tion, our Java program can automatically produce all elliptical variants. Over- and undergeneration in the resulting lists have been tested in two experiments with na- tive speakers. Basically, the rules work very well for Russian. Within the four tar- get languages, Russian works best with the Estonian amendments. Here we report two slight deviations partially known from the linguistic literature. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>In natural-language generation, ellipsis can help to avoid repetition of identical constituents. For instance, the conceptual structure eat(Peter, ap- ples) &amp; eat(Mary, apples) where eat and ap- ples occur two times can be formulated as Pe- ter eats apples and Mary too, a case of Stripping. However, many other paraphrases can be produced such as the aggregation into one sentence with NP- coordination (Peter and Mary eat apples)a case of reduction we do not address in the following as it works on the conceptual structure whereas we only deal with syntactic structures as input. Ellipsis occurs frequently in written and spoken language. In the following, we study four types of clausal coordinate ellipsis (CCE): (1) Gapping (including Long Distance Gapping (LDG), Sub- gapping and Stripping), (2) Forward Conjunc- tion Reduction (FCR), (3) Backward Conjunction Reduction (BCR), and (4) Subject Gap with Fi- nite/Fronted Verb (SGF). In German written text, clausal coordination, i.e., the two conjuncts com- prise verbal constructions (not necessarily finite), occurs in 14 and ellipsis in at least one of the two conjuncts in 7 percent of the investigated corpus (cf. Harbusch &amp; Kempen, 2007). All these types of clausal coordinate ellipsis also emerge in spon- taneous speech in German (cf. Harbusch &amp; Kem- pen, 2009a). This observation is in line with En- glish corpus studies (see, e.g., Greenbaum &amp; Nel- son, 1999) and Dutch (Harbusch, 2011). For recent theoretical treatments of CCE in var- ious linguistic frameworks see, e.g., Schwabe &amp; Zhang, 2000; Frank, 2002; Beaver &amp; Sag, 2004; te Velde, 2006; Haspelmath, 2007; Johnson, 2009; Kempen, 2009; Van Craenenbroeck &amp; Merchant, 2013; Griffiths &amp; Lipt  ak, 2014. For Russian as target language, see, e.g., Kazenin, 2006 or Grib- anova, 2013. Parsing elliptical constructions is a difficult problem partially due to the fact that both conjuncts may be grammatically incorrect when viewed in isolation (see, e.g., Kobele, 2012). In a natural-language generation-system, CCE is only one realization option (cf. Shaw 1998) out of many (e.g., Pronominalization also avoids re- peating the same NP). The implemented CCE- generation component ELLEIPO, which embod- ies the CCE rule set we present below, can serve as a post-editing component for NLG systems that provide a syntactic structure annotated with co-referentiality tags (cf. Harbusch &amp; Kempen, 2009b). ELLEIPO takes these non-elliptical (re- dundant) structures as input and provides all re- duced to CCE options as output. ELLEIPO was originally developed for Dutch and German (see Harbusch &amp; Kempen, 2006), but the implemented 75 set of CCE rules was designed in a language- independent manner. This makes it possible to dis- cover CCE rules in a new target language. For the Finno-Ugric language Estonian, Harbusch, Koit &amp; Oim (2009) report high accuracy of the rule set, which suggests that the entire process is language independent. However, Estonian is suspected to be strongly influenced by language contact with Ger- manic languages. Nevertheless, Hungarian, an- other Finno-Ugric language, yields equally good results (cf. Harbusch &amp; B  atori, 2013). In the present paper, we aim to further ver- ify our claim that CCE can be generated by language-independent rules by testing ELLEIPOs rules for Russian. To this purpose, we built a test corpus of about 100 Russian syntactic struc- tures of (unreduced) coordinated sentences in Rus- sian varying the conditions for CCE-rule applica- tion. RUSSIAN-ELLEIPO produces all CCE re- ductions for the test corpus. In the first experi- ment, we let native speakers of Russian judge the quality of the output (overgeneration of the CCE rules). In the second, native speakers generated all reductions (inclusive Pronominalization etc.) for unreduced coordinated sentences in order to spot CCE realizations that ELLEIPO does not generate (undergeneration). In general, we observed a very high level of accuracy of the CCE rules. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the CCE phenomena ELLEIPO is able to generate. In Section 3, we describe the test cor- pus, and elaborate on ELLEIPOs output and on the user studies. In Section 4, we outline our re- sults. In the final Section, we draw some conclu- sions and address future work. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Definition of the CCE Rules </heading><chunk>We distinguish four types of CCE applicable to bi- nary and-coordinations, and specify elision con- ditions on the first (anterior) and second (poste- rior) member of two conjoined clauses connected by the Russian equivalent i 1 of the coordinating conjunction and (cf. examples in Table 1). The CCE rules of ELLEIPO are based on the psycholinguistically motivated definitions of CCE types proposed by Kempen (2009). They check the following conditions in syntactic trees whose inner nodes additionally provide referential iden- tity features. 1 As in Russian, a but is used for contrasts, we vary our examples in the Gapping test where contrast is mandatory.

Crossed-out text represents elisions. Subscripts indicate CCE type. Elided constituents and their overt counterparts are marked in bold font. 76 1. Gapping ignores word order (compare exam- ple (1) with the marked word order in (2). It only requires lemma-identity of the two Verbs in the two conjuncts &amp; contrastiveness 2 of the remnants (non-elided constituents). For lemma-identity only the stems need to co- incide. However, morphological properties such as Number or Person of a Verb may differ in the two conjuncts (e.g., in exam- ple (1), ziv  et and zivut are lemma-identical). The Gapping variant Long-Distance Gapping (LDG) recursively applies the general Gap- ping conditions top-down to corresponding Verb pairs in the structure, provided they are in the range of a so-called superclause 3 in both conjuncts. Subgapping works as LDG but a Nonfinite Verb structure happens to be not identical; this yields a Nonfinite clausal remnant in the second conjunct. Stripping is applied after any form of Gapping: dur- ing read-out of Gapping results it inspects whether there is no more than one non- Verb remnant; in that case read-out adds a language-specific stripping particle. 2. Forward-Conjunction Reduction (FCR) re- quires wordform-identity, i.e., in addition to lemma- and grammatical-function iden- tity, identity of the morphological features is needed in the left-periphery of major clausal constituents, i.e., both clausal con- juncts should start with a wordform-identical sequence of FULL constituents. 3. Backward-Conjunction Reduction (BCR) is licensed by lemma-identity in the right- periphery, that is, both clausal conjuncts end with the same sequence of wordform and grammatical-function identical WORDS (e.g., in example (8), oclock is such a se- quence). Note that FCR and BCR are not 2 Contrastiveness constraints rule out elisions such as I eat apples and you eat in the carwhich is comprehensible but not grammatical. 3 A superclause is defined as a hierarchy of Finite or Non- finite Clauses thatwith the possible exception of the top- most clausedo not include a Subordinating Conjunction. In (3), the Subjects P  etr and Ma sa each belong to a Main Clause headed by the Verb dol zen should whereas segodn a today and svo u ma sinu/svoj velosiped his car/her bike be- long to the Nonfinite Complement Clause headed by the In- finitive myt  wash. Nevertheless, they form one superclause in each of the conjuncts. Example (7)actually, a case of FCR where no superclause test is elicitedcontains two su- perclauses in each conjunct, due to the Subordinating Con- junction cto that. complete mirror images because only BCR is allowed to disregarding major constituent boundaries. 4. Subject Gap with Finite/Fronted Verb (SGF) requires wordform-identical Sub- jects where the first conjunct starts with Verb/Modifier/Adjunct or where the first conjunct is a Conditional Subordinate Clause (Subject-Verb-Inversion) &amp; FCR is applied if licensed. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Set-up of RUSSIAN-ELLEIPO </heading><chunk>In order to use ELLEIPO for any new target language, the existing Java implementation of ELLEIPO has to be changed only minimally be- cause the rule set works target-language indepen- dently. We added the Russian Conjunction and the Russian Stripping particle along with its position (leading or trailing) in the language-specific part of the existing Java code. In order to test the accuracy in a new tar- get language, an appropriate test corpus of ELLEIPO should contain structures that trigger ALL constraints in the rule set, i.e., lemma- and wordform-identity, contrastiveness, grammatical- function and word-order variation in the left- and right periphery. A blueprint of such a collection is ELLEIPOs test corpus of about 100 sentences for German and Dutch (see Harbusch &amp; Kempen, 2006). All these sentences have been translated into Russian. In order to avoid biases, preserv- ing the meaning was not essential but trying to keep the varying constraints active in the Russian syntactic trees, i.e., natural constructions in Rus- sian have been set up (cf. clues for rule appli- cation/failure of all phenomena in Table 2; N.B. that several phenomena can occur in one test sen- tence). The large number of Gapping examples represents the great variety of word ordering to be ignored, contrastiveness to be obeyed, differing superclause-boundary violation-options (relevant for LDG and Subgapping), grammatical-function and lemma and wordform variation. The larger number of FCR tests compared to (the near mir- ror image) BCR results from more variation op- tions for major constituents in the frontfield of a sentence compared to the limited word variation in the right periphery in BCR. For SGF, the range of options is also restricted. Processing the Russian test corpus, ELLEIPO provides a condensed list of all reductions 77 CCE Rule Number of inclusions GAPPING 91 STRIPPING 17 FCR 72 BCR 25 SGF 17 Table 2: Phenomena in the Russian test corpus. with/without subscriptsslightly more elaborate than indicated in Table 1. ELLEIPO adds unique numbers to each CCE token so that an elided constituent and its remnant directly correspond. For instance, ELLEIPOs output for example (3) spells out the sentence vari- ant depicting Subgapping along with Backward- Conjunction Reduction (cf. subscript number #4 for BCR in Segodn a 2 3 dol zen 1 P  etr svo u ma sinu myt  4-b 2 i segodn a 2-gg 3-f dol zna 1-g Ma sa svoj velosiped myt  2-gg also notice subscript #3 li- censing segodn a for FCR). ELLEIPOs read-out component can spell out all possible combinations of elisions (with or without elaborate subscripts). The complete lists of unreduced and reduced sentences form the text materials we presented to the participants in the two experiments that we car- ried out to calculate the accuracy of our CCE rules, specifically, the amount of overgeneration and un- dergeneration of the rule set in Russian. In experi- ment 1, we targeted overgeneration. We had native speakers judge the acceptability of the elliptical structures proposed by the CCE generator for the test corpus. In experiment 2, aiming to detect un- dergeneration, we tried to elicit yet undiscovered elision types for a standard corpus of unreduced test sentences (i.e., sentences without CCE). Ob- viously, the scope of the latter experiment is re- stricted, due to the limited number and variability of the sentences presented to the participants. We used a rating scale specifying three levels of acceptability of a reduced sentence (good, du- bious, unacceptable) in order to avoid overtaxing and exhausting the test subjectsin contrast to the very fine-grained method for grammaticality rat- ing used by Keller (2000). In case of dubious ac- ceptability, more details have been asked. Basi- cally, a more fine-grained tendency for more/less acceptability as well as insights in misinterpreta- tions have been traced. This type of comments was obtained in an interview situation with a moderator. 4 The moderator should be a linguist </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Further options are unmoderated tests conducted in an </heading><chunk>speaking the target language to bring up follow- up questions. Such digression does not spoil the studycompared to a standardized experiment as in Psychology. Another deviation from stan- dardized testing (originally proposed for Usabil- ity (UX) Testing and verified with a meta-study on case studies by Nielsen (2012)) works very well here. Few test subjectsJakob Nielsen suggests five in UX, although, user behavior varies more than in grammaticality ratingsuffice to point out the majority of all problems. In experiment 1, we let three native speakers of Russian evaluate ELLEIPOs output. The partic- ipants always saw unreduced sentences together with the reduced ones. This setup is necessary be- cause it is known that, although some reductions are acceptable in themselves, they do not express the same meaning as its unreduced counterpart (cf. example (12) in next section). We counted a match as successful if at least one participant judged it acceptable. 5 In experiment 2, we tried to identify undergen- eration with the CCE rule set, i.e., judged ac- ceptable by native speakers but failing to be pro- duced by ELLEIPO. For this purpose we presented unreduced sentences only and let the participants freely produce any kind of reduction crossing their mind. In the list of answers we first identified Pronominalization, One-anaphora and other non- CCE forms of ellipsis as they do not count in our study (however, the participants cannot know this). Given the high amount of different linguistic constructions the participants produced, the moti- vation of the participants during the experiments can be judged to be high (so to speak playful in a positive sense). The experiment unveiled great similarities of Russian with Estonian and Hun- garian which allow weaker word-ordering condi- tions for SGF and FCR (e.g., Ditransitive Verbs allow for non-peripheral elision of wordform and grammatical-function identical constituents). observation lab or (internet) questionnaires. The user stud- ies for Estonian, Hungarian and Russian were conducted as face-to-face interviews to make test subjects try considerably harder (cf. Schulte-Mecklenbeck and Huber, 2003). More- over, all kinds of misinterpretation can be discussed on the spot given that the moderator remains neutral in order to min- imize unwelcome influence on the results of the test. 5 This weak acceptability criterion was prompted by the fact that CCE acceptability ratings can give rise to wide inter- rater variability. In German, grammar books (and ELLEIPO) license BCR for constituents that are lemma-identical but not grammatical-function identical. However, many German na- tive speakers rule out Hilf [dem Mann]DAT und reanimier [den Mann]ACC Help and reanimate the man. 78 4 Results In experiment 1 (on overgeneration), 79 % of the sentences produced by ELLEIPO were judged acceptable. At a first glance this sounds mea- ger. However, one should realize that if ELLEIPO wrongly applies a CCE rule, it does so for all sen- tences embodying the same trigger condition. Sec- ond experiment accomplished 97 % accuracy. The number of identified CCE tokens along with over- and undergeneration cases by type of CCE rules is shown in Figure 1. Note: the columns show abso- lute numbers, not percentages. Figure 1: Numbers of cases revealing over- and undergeneration in the two experiments. Comparison of our Russian data with those ob- tained in previous work for the two Finno-Ugric languages revealed interesting similarities. In Estonian and Hungarian, the left-periphery con- straint is less strict compared to Dutch and Ger- man. In SGF, Estonian and Hungarian allow for more freedom in the frontfield whereas this is not possible in Dutch and German. In Russian, Argu- ments in the frontfield also license FCR (cf. exam- ple (10) with a Complement Clause in the front- field).

In Long-Distance and Subgapping, ex- actly two constituents may remain in the second conjunct (see example (12) where the participants interpret the reduced sentence as you are in the bus). Obviously, in Russian any inflected form of to be is assumed to be left out for two remain- ing remnants instead of taking into account the Verbal constituents in the anterior conjunct. No- tice, that we expected this reaction as this Russian- specific CCE phenomenon is discussed in the lit- erature (see, e.g., Kazenin, 2006).

In this sentence, the constituents svoj velosiped his bike cannot be elided by Gapping because the two constituents refer to two different referential objects (4 % of the reduced corpus sen- tences were rejected due to this fact).

Russian ellipsis reveals the highest similarity to Estonian if written text quality is considered. As for future work, we plan to conduct a corpus study into Russian treebanks of spoken and writ- ten language in order to find additional subtle de- viations that go beyond our studies (cf. Harbusch &amp; Kempen, 2007). 79 Acknowledgements We thank Gerard Kempen for helpful discussions on earlier versions of the paper, and three review- ers for constructive criticism.
