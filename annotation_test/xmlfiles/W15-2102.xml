Lexicon Embedded Syntax Alain Polgu` ere ATILF UMR 7118, CNRS-Universit  e de Lorraine 44 avenue de la Lib  eration, BP 30687 54063 Nancy cedex, France alain.polguere@univ-lorraine.fr Abstract This paper explores the notion of lexicon embedded syntax: syntactic structures that are preassembled in natural language lex- icons. Section 1 proposes a lexicologi- cal perspective on (dependency) syntax: first, it deals with the well-known problem of lexicon-grammar dichotomy, then intro- duces the notion of lexicon embedded syn- tax and, finally, presents the lexical mod- els this discussion is based on: lexical sys- tems, as implemented in the English and French Lexical Networks. Two cases of lexicon embedded syntax are then treated: the syntax of idioms, section 2, and the syntax of collocations, section 3. Section 4 concludes on the possible exploitation of syntactic structures that can be extracted from lexical systems. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Lexicological Perspective on Syntax </heading></section><section><heading>1.1 Lexicon-Grammar Dichotomy </heading><chunk>The task of modeling languages is often equated with a task of writing so-called grammars. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that most theoret- ical proposals in modern linguistics are designated as specific types of grammars: Generative Gram- mar, Case Grammar, Lexical Functional Gram- mar, Word Grammar, Generalized Phrase Struc- ture Grammar, Construction Grammar(s), Role and Reference Grammar, Functional Discourse Grammar, etc. (Polgu` ere, 2011, pp 8283). It should be noted that this focalization on an all- encompassing notion of grammar runs deep. For instance, the 1795 law that created the school of oriental language studies in France (INALCO 1 ) specified as follows the linguistic descriptive task assigned to its professors: 1 http://www.inalco.fr Lesdits professeurs composeront en franc  ais la grammaire des langues quils enseigneront: ces divers ouvrages seront remis au comit  e dinstruction publique. 2 No mention of a need to compile dictionaries for oriental languages, as if it were natural to des- ignate with the term grammar the main tool to be used by XVIII th century officials and merchants for communicating with locals. It should be stressed that this rather confusing notion of Gram- mar with a capital G is extremely broad and en- compasses the set of all linguistic rules that make up a natural language. It is distinct from the gram- mar as a language module that stands in opposi- tion with its functional counterpart: the lexicon. Both linguistic modules have been loosely charac- terized as follows by O. Jespersen in terms of their corresponding fields of study: [g]rammar deals with the general facts of language, and lexicology with special facts (Jespersen, 1924, p 32). In the present discussion, we will strictly abide by the above characterization and consider the grammar of a language as being the system of all general rules of that language i.e. rules that are not properties assigned to given words and the lexicon of that language as being the system of all its word-specific rules. It is a well-established fact that there exists a blurry demarcation between grammar and lexicon (Keizer, 2007). Rules that are specific to linguistic entities that present analogies with words but are not strictly speaking lexical units are less lexical in nature and possess a certain grammatical flavor. For instance, rules that account for the properties 2 Said professors will elaborate in French the grammar of languages they will be teaching: these various books will be submitted to the public instruction committee. 2 of bound morphemes (the English derivative suf- fix -ly, the prefix poly-, etc.) belong to the lexi- con because they are specific to a linguistic sign, hence not general, but they are borderline due to the morphological nature of the sign in question. In what follows, quite a few linguistic entities will be presented as belonging to lexical models based on this preliminary characterization of the respec- tive scope of grammar and lexicon and in spite of widespread practices that may tend to view lexi- cons strictly as repositories of lexical units. </chunk></section><section><heading>1.2 Focus on Lexicon Embedded Syntax </heading><chunk>Another factor that blurs the lexicon-grammar par- tition is the very fact that, in any natural language, a considerable number of syntactic structures are preassembled in the lexicon. Valency-controlled dependencies whose modeling is directly rele- vant to lexicological studies are the most ob- vious manifestation of this phenomenon. A va- lency dictionary or lexical database (Fillmore et al., 2003; Mertens, 2010) is nothing but a lexi- cographic description of a significant part of lex- icon embedded syntax. This fact is now widely acknowledged. What is much less known and/or taken into account, specially in Natural Language Processing, is the extent to which syntactic struc- tures of natural languages find their origins in lex- icons, thanks to the omnipresence of phraseology (Becker, 1975). In what follows, we will focus of two types of lexicon embedded syntactic structures: lexico-syntactic structures of idioms (sec- tion 2); collocational syntactic structures (section 3). We are particularly interested in showing how a rich formal lexical model (see 1.3 below) can account for lexicon embedded syntax and serve as repository of canned syntactic structures that are directly extractable from lexical data. </chunk></section><section><heading>1.3 Lexical Systems </heading><chunk>In order to provide data for the proper treatment of lexicon embedded syntax, lexical models need to have phraseological genes: they have to be based on theoretical and descriptive principles that fully take into consideration the omnipres- ence of phraseology in natural languages. Such is the case of Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel cuk et al., 1995; Mel cuk, 2006), that is be- ing used as theoretical background in the present discussion. More specifically, we will refer to a new type of lexical model built within this frame- work lexical systems (Polgu` ere, 2009) , using two specific instances of such models: the English and French Lexical Networks hereafter, en- and fr-LNs. Lexical systems are huge graphs of intercon- nected lexical entities. Polgu` ere (2014) discusses the rationale behind the choice of this particular type of structure, formally characterized by four main properties. Property 1. The lexical system of a language L is mathematically defined as an oriented graph: a set of nodes and a set of oriented edges (= ordered pairs of nodes). Nodes correspond, first, to lexical units of L (lexemes and idioms) and, second, to quasi-lexical units (linguistic clich  es, prover- bial clauses, etc.). Edges correspond primarily to Meaning-Text lexical function relations (Mel cuk, 1996). 3 Property 2. Nodes of the graph are non-atomic entities. They are containers for a rich variety of semantic and combinatorial information about the corresponding unit (grammatical characteris- tics, definition, etc.); they also contain pointers to lexicographic examples (sense illustrations), their content being informationally analogous to that of dictionary articles (Polgu` ere, 2014, pp 1516). Property 3. Lexical systems possess a non- ontological graph structure that belongs to the family of so-called small-world networks. As such, they display remarkable mathematical prop- erties (Gader et al., 2014, 3) that can be used to extract node clusters corresponding to seman- tic spaces (Polgu` ere, 2014, 2.2.2). Property 4. Each important piece of informa- tion in lexical systems (existence of a lexical unit, assignment of a grammatical characteristic, lexi- cal link, etc.) possesses an associated measure of 3 Other relations are, at the moment: copolysemy links (FOREST 1 [of oak trees] and FOREST 2 [of antennas] belong to the same polysemic vocable and are connected by a re- lation of metaphor), definitional inclusions (the meaning of DOG is included in the definition of [to] BARK) and formal inclusions (the lexeme BULLET is formally included in the lexico-syntactic structure of the idiom BITE THE BULLET) we will examine this latter type of relation in section 2 below. 3 confidence that can be used to perform probabilis- tic computing on the graph. Measurement of con- fidence is particularly relevant for the implemen- tation of analogical reasoning on lexical models. Figure 1 illustrates the graph structure of lexical systems. It visualizes a semantic space controlled by the French lexeme FOR ET I forest in the fr- LN. In this figure, spatialization and coloring of nodes visualize the result of an automatic seman- tic clustering performed on the lexical graph; this mode of visualization reflects semantic proximity inferred from the topology of the graph (Chudy et al., 2013). Work on lexical systems started with exper- iments on the mechanical compilation of tra- ditional Explanatory and Combinatorial models (Polgu` ere, 2009), then evolved into full-scale lex- icography with the construction of the fr-LN, the first manually-built lexical system (Lux-Pogodalla and Polgu` ere, 2011; Gader et al., 2012). While lexicographically developing the fr-LN, a first ver- sion of a lexical system for the English language the en-LN has been automatically compiled from the Princeton WordNet (Gader et al., 2014). This latter lexical system offers a large-scale coverage of English in terms of wordlist. It is however es- sentially based on synonymy-like relations, inher- ited from WordNet; only the fr-LN fully reflects the amplitude of both paradigmatic and syntag- matic lexical function relations. Additionally, it is only in the fr-LN that the actual Explanatory Com- binatorial approach to phraseology is fully imple- mented at present. For this reason, we will need to use both French and English illustrations in the following discussion, depending on the availabil- ity of data in the current language models. Table 1 gives statistics on the en- and fr-LNs in their present state.

By this we mean lexico-syntactic struc- tures that are associated with idioms in the fr-LN. 4 Because they are semantically non- compositional, idioms are considered as full- fledged lexical units in Explanatory Combinato- rial Lexicology. For this reason, they possess, just like lexemes, their own individual description in the fr-LN. On the one hand, the behavior of idioms is known to be highly irregular (for instance, some idioms allow syntactic modification on some of their lexical constituents and other do not); on the other hand, it can be expected that general rules could be identified that condition part of id- ioms behaviors, based on their lexico-syntactic structure. For this reason, it has been decided to specify, for each individual idiom in the fr-LN wordlist, its constitutive lexemes and its basic syn- tactic structure (Paus  e, to appear). This is imple- mented as follows. First, each phrasal part of speech nominal idiom, verbal idiom, etc. is linked to a set of syntactic templates that identify possible syn- tactic structures for idioms belonging to this part of speech. For instance, the verbal idiom part of speech (Fr. locution verbale) is associated, among others, with a syntactic template named V Art NC (Verb + Article + Common noun) that designates the syntactic structure shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Syntactic structure of the V Art NC idiom template. Second, each time an idiom is created in the fr- LN, two operations are performed: 1. the newly created idiom is linked to one of the syntactic templates associated to its part of speech; 4 Work on assigning lexico-syntactic structures to idioms in the en-LN has not started yet and all our examples in this section will therefore be borrowed from French. 4 Figure 1: Semantic space controlled by Fr. FOR ET I forest in the French Lexical Network (fr-LN) 2. lexical nodes in this syntactic template are linked to actual lexical units that make up the idiom. For instance, Figure 3 shows how the lexico-syntactic structure of the idiom SUCRER LES FRAISES I to tremble because of advanced age (lit. to sugar.the.strawberries) 5 is specified on the V Art NC template using the fr-LN lexicographic editor. In this figure, names appearing in the Sense column correspond to actual pointers to lexemes (senses) of the fr-LN; names in the Form column are only wordforms that will be used when displaying the instantiated syntactic template. (If nothing is specified, the name in the corresponding Sense cell will be displayed.) Figure 3: Specifying a lexico-syntactic structure. Once the lexico-syntactic structure of SUCRER LES FRAISES I has been fully in- 5 There is another sense SUCRER LES FRAISES II, de- rived from the first one, that means to be senile. stanciated (Figure 3), in can be interpreted by the general hence, grammatical syntactic template of Figure 2 in order to derive the fully lexicalized syntactic structure shown in Figure 4. 6 Figure 4: Syntax of SUCRER LES FRAISES I. To our knowledge, the fr-LN is the first lexi- cal database that systematically accounts for the lexico-syntactic structure of idioms it contains in point of fact, current lexical resources seldom provide individual descriptions for idioms. At present, it is possible to derive from fr-LN data 3,018 syntactic structures of individual idioms (such as that in Figure 4), which is only a small portion of the syntax of idioms embedded in the French lexicon. 6 An important piece of information is missing in this structure: the fact that the lexeme FRAISE 1 1 has to carry the grammeme plural (sucrer les fraises and not *sucrer la fraise). The fr-LN does not support yet the spec- ification of grammemes in idiom syntactic structures. 5 3 Syntax of Collocations </chunk></section><section><heading>3.1 Functional notion of collocation </heading><chunk>We now examined a second case of lexicon em- bedded syntax: the syntax of collocations. Collo- cation is understood here as designating a func- tional rather than statistical notion (Hausmann, 1979); it can be defined as follows. A collocation, e.g. to run a fever, is a phraseological but compositional phrase made up of two main elements: 1. a semantically autonomous ele- ment fever called base of the collocation; 2. a bound element to run called collocate of the base; the collo- cate is said to be bound, or not free, because its selection by the Speaker in order to express a given meaning depends on the prior se- lection of the base. As collocations are modeled in lexical systems by means of standard syntagmatic lexical func- tions, we will start with a brief presentation of the notion of lexical functions (3.2). We will then pro- ceed with the interpretation of syntagmatic lexical functions as a special type of grammar rules (3.3). Finally (3.4), we will show how such rules can be used to derive a considerable amount syntactic structures embedded in natural language lexicons. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.2 Standard Lexical Functions </heading><chunk>A given standard lexical function is a generaliza- tion of a lexical link that possesses the following properties: it is either paradigmatic (synonyms, antonyms, nominalizations, verbaliza- tions, actant names, etc.) or syntagmatic (collocates that are intensifiers [driving rain], light verbs [to run a fever], etc.); it is recurrent and universally present in natu- ral languages; it is often (though not necessarily) expressed by morphological means (drive driver [ac- tant name], store megastore [intensifier], etc.). For instance, Magn is the standard lexical func- tion that denotes collocational intensifiers; it can be applied to any full lexical unit in order to re- turn the set of all typical intensifiers for that unit. 7 This is illustrated in (1), with the two semantically related units FEVER and HEADACHE as arguments of Magn. (1) a. Magn( fever ) = high &lt; raging b. Magn( headache ) = bad, severe &lt; ter- rible, violent &lt; pounding, splitting Note that collocative meanings can sometimes be expressed synthetically (within a paradigmatically related term) rather than analytically (as collo- cates). This phenomenon is call fusion and fused values of syntagmatic lexical functions are flagged with the // symbol in lexicographic descriptions; for instance: (2) Magn( rain V ) = hard, heavily, //pour down Years of lexical studies on a wide spectrum of natural languages have allowed for the identifica- tion of a now stable set of approximately 65 sim- ple lexical functions; 8 additionally, these functions can be combined to form complex lexical functions (Kahane and Polgu` ere, 2001). The system of lexical functions is a descriptive tool that allows for a rationalization and formal- ization of the web of paradigmatic and syntag- matic links that connect lexical units in natural lan- guages. This explains why we have adopted lexi- cal functions as the main structuring principle for lexical systems. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.3 Standard Syntagmatic Lexical Functions as Grammar Rules </heading><chunk>We will now focus on standard syntagmatic lexi- cal functions in order to examine how they offer an original treatment of the syntax of collocations. For this, we will use as illustration one specific standard syntagmatic lexical function: Real 1 . It is commonly characterized as follows. The lexical function application Real 1 ( L ) stands for a full verb: that expresses such meanings as to realize L, to do what is supposed to be done as regards to L . . . ; 7 A lexical function is thus quite similar to an algebraic function f, that can be applied to a given number x in order to return a given value y: f( x ) = y. 8 The exact number of lexical functions varies according to the descriptive granularity one wants to adopt. 6 that takes L as second deep- syntactic actant (i.e. first comple- ment) and the first deep-syntactic actant of L as its first deep- syntactic actant (i.e. grammatical subject). 9 In case of fusion, the meaning L is encapsu- lated in the meaning of the lexical function appli- cation, together with the sense of realization, and therefore //Real 1 ( L ) doesnt take L as second syn- tactic actant. As an illustration, Figure 5 gives the so-called article-view of Real 1 values for BALLOON N 2 [We could get there by balloon.] in the en-LN. 10 Figure 5: Real 1 ( balloon N 2 ) in the en-LN. Standard lexical functions such as Real 1 can be conceptualized from at least two perspectives. From the viewpoint of the structure of lexical knowledge, they are universal relations that paradigmatically and syntagmatically con- nect lexical units within lexical systems. From the viewpoint of the universal system of deep-syntactic paraphrasing (Mel cuk, 2013, Chap. 9), they are meta lexical units whose application to a given lexical unit (argument of the lexical function) stands for a set possi- ble lexicalizations in a deep-syntactic struc- ture. In this latter case, it is important to note that each standard syntagmatic lexical function actu- ally denotes two dependency structures: one for normal values of the lexical function applica- tion and one for fused values. Therefore, the two deep-syntactic trees 11 in Figure 6 are inher- ently associated to Real 1 . If we refer to what was said earlier about the lexicon-grammar dichotomy (section 1.1), we are 9 On the notions of semantic and deep-/surface-syntactic actants, see Mel cuk (2015, Chap. 12). 10 An article-view, in the lexicographic editor used for building the en- and fr-LNs, is a textual rendering of lexical data associated with a given headword. For details on how lexical function applications are computationally encoded in the en- and fr-LNs, see Gader et al. (2012). 11 For a concise presentation of Meaning-Text levels of sentence representation and the deep- vs. surface-syntax di- chotomy, see Kahane (2003). Figure 6: Real 1 s Deep-syntactic structures. entitled to consider that trees in Figure 6, because they correspond to general (in this case, universal) linguistic rules about syntactic structuring, are in essence grammatical: they designate syntactic po- tential that can be run on any lexical rules of the type illustrated in Figure 5 in order to participate in the generation of actual surface-syntactic struc- tures. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.4 Deriving surface-syntactic structures </heading><chunk>In this particular case, rules in Figures 5 and 6 allow for the generation of the three surface- syntactic structures in Figure 7. Figure 7: Derived surface-syntactic structures. If we consider the prospect of such derivation throughout a full lexical system for a given lan- guage, we see that a considerable amount of lexi- con embedded syntactic structures are extractable from these models. At present, a total number of 7,739 surface-syntactic micro-structures of the type given in Figure 7 can be extracted from the fr-LN. 12 This is of course only a small portion of what is available in the actual French lexicon. 12 This corresponds to the number of syntagmatic lexical function relations already woven in the fr-LN. 7 4 Conclusion: Lexicalized Grammars the Other Way Round By presenting the syntax of idioms and colloca- tions, we hope to have shown that syntactic in- formation embedded in natural language lexicons goes far beyond phenomena associated to active valency (subcategorization frames). Lexicon em- bedded syntax is conceptually and quantitatively an essential element of lexical knowledge. It was also our goal to demonstrate that lexical systems such as the fr-LN are particularly suited to the modeling of embedded syntax. In our view, one very promising exploitation of such models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the use of large collections of extracted syntactic struc- tures by NLP parsers, for such tasks as disam- biguation or processing of phraseological expres- sions found in corpora. Collections of syntactic structures extractable from lexical systems bear some conceptual resem- blance with lexicalized grammars (Schabes et al., 1988), except for the fact that the perspective is to- tally inverted: rather than lexicalizing grammars, we propose to extract from lexical systems every- thing actual grammars do not know about syntax.
