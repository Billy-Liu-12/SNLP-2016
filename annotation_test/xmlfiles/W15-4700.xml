ENLG is a biennial series, which started with a workshop in Royaumont, France in 1987 and was most recently held in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2013. Together with the International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG), held in alternate years, ENLG is the main forum for research on all aspects of the generation of natural language. This year, ENLG has a special theme on Image and Video Description. Vision and Language more generally has, over the past five years, become a research field in its own right, a development reflected for example in the recently introduced Vision and Language areas at ACL and EMNLP. Image and video description is the obvious vision and language application for NLG and with this special theme we are aiming both to provide a forum for existing work and to stimulate new research. We are delighted to have two invited speakers addressing the special theme in different ways. Mirella Lapata reports her work investigating how best to interpret and verbalise visual information, while Pinar Duygulu-Sahin provides a broader overview of image and video description work with a focus on weakly labelled images. We received a total of 41 submissions for the workshop, from all over the world not only Europe, but North and South America, Asia and Australasia and accepted 11 as long papers for oral presentation, 13 as short papers for poster presentation, and 3 as demos. This volume contains all the accepted papers, as well as the abstracts by the two invited speakers. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, and the members of our program committee, for helping to ensure the high standard and continuing health of ENLG 2015 and of NLG research in general.

The requirement for manual labeling continues to be one of the most important limitations in large scale recognition. Alternatively, massive amount of images and videos with annotated metadata or descriptions are available on the Web. Although incomplete and errorful,availability of these annotations recently attracted many researchers to build (semi-)automatic methods to learn from weakly labeled data. However, images on the web are in the wild resulting in challenges that makes the data collections gathered from web different from the hand crafted datasets. In this talk, first I will discuss the challenges in learning from weakly labeled images, Then, I will describe our recent efforts on recognition of visual attributes, as well as objects, scenes and faces on the large scale using weakly labeled images. Going beyond images, finally I will briefly discuss the issues in videos. Mirella Lapata (University of Edinburgh, UK): Learning to Interpret and Describe Abstract Scenes Given a (static) scene, a human can effortlessly describe what is going on (who is doing what to whom, how, and why). The process requires knowledge about the world, how it is perceived, and described. In this talk I will focus on the problem of interpreting and verbalizing visual information using abstract scenes created from collections of clip art images. I will introduce a model inspired by machine translation (where the task is to transform a source sentence into its target translation) and argue that generating descriptions for scenes is quite similar, but with a twist: the translation process is very loose and selective; there will always be objects in a scene not worth mentioning, and words in a description that will have no visual counterpart. Our key insight is to represent scenes via visual dependency relations corresponding to senten- tial descriptions. This allows us to create a large parallel corpus for training a statistical machine translation system, which we interface with a content selection component guiding the transla- tion toward interesting or important scene content. Advantageously, our model can be used in the reverse direction, i.e., to generate scenes, without additional engineering effort. Our approach out- performs a number of competitive alternatives, when evaluated both automatically and by humans.
