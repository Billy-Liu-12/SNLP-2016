Specifically, we look at: a) the counting properties of dot-types, and b) the case of a complex dot-type that has remained unsolved in the literature, i.e. that of newspaper. As re- gards a), we show that the account proposed in (Luo, 2010) for dot-types makes the cor- rect predictions as regards counting. In order to verify this, we implement the account in the Coq proof-assistant and check that the desired inferences follow. Then, we look at the case of b), the case of a dot-type which is both re- source and context sensitive. We propose a further resource sensitive version of the dot- type, in effect a linear dot-type. This along with local coercions can account for the be- haviour attested. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Copredication: Dot Types and Individuation Criteria </heading><chunk>One of the issues that should be taken care of when giving an account of co-predication, concerns cases of coordination like the one shown below: (1) John picked up and mastered three books In the above sentence, the CN book is used in its physical sense (PHY) with respect to the predicate This work is partially supported by the research grants from Leverhulme, Royal Academy of Engineering, the CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams as well as the ANR ContInt Polymnie project in France. picked up, while for the predicate mastered it is rather used in its informational content sense (INFO). A theory of co-predication should be able to take care of these facts. This is true for the account by means of the dot-types proposed by (Luo, 2010; Luo, 2012b). However, besides capturing this be- haviour of dot objects, there is an additional prop- erty that has to be captured. The account provided must also make the correct predictions as regards in- dividuation and counting. Let us explain. Consider the following sentences: (2) John picked up three books (3) John mastered three books (4) John picked up and mastered three books The first example (2) is true in case John picked three distinct physical objects. Thus, it is compatible with a situation where John picked up three copies of the same book. (3) is true in case three distinct informational objects are mastered but does not im- pose any restrictions on whether these three infor- mational objects should be different physical objects or not. To the contrary, (4) is only compatible with an interpretation where three distinct physical ob- jects as well as three distinct informational objects is involved. 1 Another issue pertaining to dot types concerns cases of what Retor  e (2014) calls rigid and flexi- ble coercions in co-predication cases. These cases in contrast to cases like Book where both senses can 1 This is basically an issue of how complex objects, i.e. dot- types, are individuated and stems from the work of (Asher, 2008; Asher, 2011). 39 be coordinated, involve examples where if one of the senses is used the other one cannot be used anymore: (5) Liverpool is spread out and voted (last Sun- day). (6) # Liverpool voted and won (last Sunday). Perhaps a better example for such cases is Puste- jovskys newspaper examples. The CN newspaper is associated with three senses: a) physical object, b) informational object and c) institution. It is a strange fact that whereas senses a) and b) can appear together in a coordinated structure, sense c) cannot appear with any of the other two (examples taken from (Antunes and Chaves, 2003)): (7) # That newspaper is owned by a trust and is covered with coffee. (8) # The newspaper fired the reporter and fell off the table. (9) # John sued and ripped the newspaper. Pustejovskys proposal (Pustejovsky, 1995) to treat newspaper as a composite dot object does not ex- plain the above facts. Likewise, the proposal of us- ing (ordinary) dot-types in (Luo, 2010) has a simi- lar problem: one would consider newspaper to be a subtype of the dot-type INST (PHY INFO), which would not disallow the above bad examples. The picture gets complicated in the light of examples like the following, in which it seems that the institutional sense can be used together with one of the two other senses in some cases: (10) The newspaper you are reading is being sued by Mia. As far as we know, no satisfactory account has been provided to these questions yet. In this paper, following earlier work on dot-types in MTTs (Luo, 2010; Luo, 2012b; Xue and Luo, 2012) and coor- dination (Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2012), we take up the challenge of providing an account that cor- rectly predicts the individuation criteria in cases of co-predication while it furthermore provides a first look at capturing the behaviour of problematic cases like newspaper. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Formal Semantics in Modern Type Theories: a Brief Introduction </heading><chunk>The term Modern Type Theories (MTTs) refers to type theories studied and developed within the tradi- tion of Martin-L  of, which include predicative type theories such as Martin-L  ofs type theory (Nord- str  om et al., 1990) and impredicative type theories such as CIC p as implemented in Coq (The Coq team, 2007) and UTT (Luo, 1994). Formal semantics in Modern Type Theories (MTT-semantics for short) was first studied by Ranta in his pioneering work (Ranta, 1994). 2 It has been further developed in the last several years, including the crucial employment of the theory of coercive subtyping (Luo, 1999; Luo, Soloviev and Xue, 2012) among other developments and made MTT-semantics a viable and full-blown alternative to the traditional Montagovian frame- work. In this paper, we use one such modern type theory, UTT with Coercive Subtyping (Luo, 1994; Luo, 1999), whose application to linguistic seman- tics was first discussed in (Luo, 2010). Two features of MTTs are worth being men- tioned, both important for being a foundational lan- guage for linguistic semantics. The first is that an MTT has a consistent internal logic according to the propositions-as-types principle (Curry and Feys, 1958; Howard, 1980). 3 For instance, the higher- order logic is embedded in UTT and it is essentially used when we employ UTT for linguistic semantics (just like how higher-order logic is used in Mon- tagues semantics.) The second feature of MTTs is that it has rich type structures, which have been recognised by many re- searchers as very useful in formal semantics. In this 2 Potentially, even further back, with the work of Sundholm (Sundholm, 1986; Sundholm, 1989), but Ranta (Ranta, 1994) was the first systematic study of formal semantics in a modern type theory. 3 Having such an internal logic is a basic requirement for a type theory to be employed for linguistic semantics and we need to be careful to keep the internal logic to be consistent when trying to extend an existing type theory to do linguistic semantics, for otherwise, we could be in a muddle situation if the basic requirement is violated. For instance, the framework of Type Theory with Records (TTR) (Cooper, 2011) is based on set theory and, as a consequence, TTR does not have such an internal logic based on the propositions-as-types principle (to see this, it suffices to note that TTRs a : A is just the set- theoretical membership relation a A and undecidable). 40 section, we shall briefly discuss some of these dis- tinctive features of MTTs, specifically the ones most relevant to this paper. </chunk></section><section><heading>2.1 Type Many-sortedness and CNs as Types </heading><chunk>The domain of individuals in MTTs is multi-sorted and not single-sorted as in Churchs simple type the- ory (Church, 1940). Instead of using one coarse- grained domain of entities, like it is done in the Mon- tague Semantics (MS) (Montague, 1974), MTTs contain many types that allow one to make fine- grained distinctions between individuals and further use those different types to interpret subclasses of individuals. For example, one can find John : [[man]] and M ary : [[woman]], where [[man]] and [[woman]] are different types. A further difference closely related to type many- sortedness concerns the interpretation of CNs. In MS, CNs are interpreted as predicates of type e t, whereas in MTTs CNs are interpreted as types. Thus, in MTTs, CNs man, human, table and book are interpreted as types [[man]], [[human]], [[table]] and [[book]], respectively. (Such types may be de- fined by means of type constructors such as etc see below.) Then, individuals are interpreted as being of one of the types used to interpret CNs. Such interpretations of CNs as types would not work without a proper subtyping mechanism that extends MTTs coercive subtyping provides us with such a framework. 4 </chunk></section><section><heading>2.2 Rich Typing </heading><chunk>Type structures in MTTs are very rich. They can be used to represent collections of objects (or construc- tive sets, informally) in a model-theoretic sense, al- though they are syntactic entities in MTTs. Elabo- rating on the expressiveness of typing structures of MTTs, we briefly mention the following type struc- tures: Dependent sum types (-types (A, B) which have product types A B as a special case). -types have been used to interpret intersec- tive and subsective adjectives without the need 4 See (Luo, 1999; Luo, Soloviev and Xue, 2012) for the for- mal details of coercive subtyping. Also see (Luo, 2012a) and the next section for further argumentation on interpreting CNs as types. of resorting to meaning postulates. The infer- ences follow directly from typing (Ranta, 1994; Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2013). Note that subtyping is essential for the -type to work (Luo, 2012b). Dependent product types (-types (A, B), which have arrow-types A B as a special case). These are basic dependent types that, together with universes (see below), provide polymorphism among other things. To give an example, verb modifying adverbs are typed by means of dependent -types (together with the universe CN of common nouns) (Luo, 2012b; Chatzikyriakidis, 2014). Disjoint union types (A + B). Disjoint union types have been proposed to give interpreta- tions of privative adjectives (Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2013). Universes. These are types of types, basi- cally collections of types. Typical examples of universes in MTT-semantics include, among others, the universe P rop of logical proposi- tions as found in impredicative type theories and the universe CN of (the interpretations of) common nouns (Luo, 2012b). Further uses of universes can be seen in (Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2012) where the universe LT ype of all linguistic types is used in order to deal with co- ordination. Dot-types (A B). These are special types in- troduced to study co-predication (Luo, 2012b). It is worth mentioning that coercive subtyping is essentially employed in the formulation of dot-types. 5 </chunk></section><section><heading>2.3 MTT-semantics is Both Proof-theoretic and Model-theoretic </heading><chunk>It has been noted recently (Luo, 2014) that one of the advantages of MTT-semantics as compared to traditional Montagovian approaches is that MTT- semantics can be seen as being both model-theoretic and proof-theoretic. NL semantics can first be repre- sented in an MTT in a model-theoretic way and then 5 See (Bassac et al., 2010) for another proposal of using co- ercions to deal with co-predication. 41 these semantic representations can be understood in- ferentially in a proof-theoretic way (Luo, 2014). In particular, since MTTs are proof-theoretically specified, it is not surprising that many proof as- sistants implement MTTs. Perhaps, the most ad- vanced of these proof-assistants is the Coq proof- assistant (The Coq team, 2007). Coq is a state-of- the-art proof assistant that has produced a number of impressive results. Some of these include a com- plete mechanized proof of the four colour theorem (Gonthier, 2005), the odd order theorem (Gonthier et al., 2013) as well as CompCert, a formally verified compiler for C (Leroy, 2013). Because Coq has a powerful reasoning ability and that it implements an MTT, a new avenue of research is opened up to use Coq as an NL reasoner. This has been attempted in (Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2014a; Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2014b) with a number of promising results as regards NL inference. In this paper, we also ex- emplify the way proof-assistants can be used to help in checking the inferences that semantic accounts give rise to. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 CNs as Types and Individuation Criteria </heading><chunk>As already discussed in our introduction to MTTs, CNs are interpreted as types in MTTs. This pro- posal has also some nice consequences concerning what Geach (1962) has called the criterion of iden- tity, which is pretty much the individuation criterion that we have been referring to in this paper. Intu- itively, a CN determines a concept that beside hav- ing a criterion of application to be employed to de- termine whether the concept applies to an object, it further involves a criterion of identity, to be em- ployed to determine whether two objects of the con- cept are the same. It has been argued that CNs are distinctive in this as other lexical terms like verbs and adjectives do not have such criteria of identity (cf. the arguments in (Baker, 2003)). There seems to be a close link between the constructive notion of a set (Type) and criteria of identity/individuation. This is because, in constructive mathematics, a set is a preset, which involves its application crite- rion, together with an equality, which further gives its criterion of identity determining whether two ob- jects of the set are the same (Bishop, 1967; Beeson, 1985). Modern type theories such as Martin-L  ofs type theory (Martin-L  of, 1975; Martin-L  of, 1984) were originally developed for the formalisation of constructive mathematics, where each type is asso- ciated with such an equality or criterion of identity. The identification of CNs as types thus provides CNs their criteria of application and identity. We cannot go into the details of how this is to be achieved for- mally. but the interested reader is directed to (Luo, 2012a) for a detailed exposition of the CNs as Types idea. In order to proceed, firstly we have to discuss the existing account of dot-types as this was given by (Luo, 2010; Luo, 2012b; Xue and Luo, 2012). Specifically, we have to see whether this account predicts the counting criteria correctly in examples like (4) repeated below: (11) John picked up and mastered three books As we have said, the only possible interpretation of (11) we receive is one where three distinct physical as well as informational objects are involved. The sentences cannot be interpreted as involving three distinct informational objects but one physical ob- ject or vice versa as involving three distinct physical objects but one informational object. The question is whether this account captures that. First of all, let us say something about coordination, since this would be needed in discussing the examples in a composi- tional manner. The approach we suggest for coor- dination, based on earlier work in (Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2012) involves a type universe of linguistic types, LT ype: 6 (12) A : LT ype. A A A As regards typing the above is a natural way to en- code coordination. However, we need a way to fur- ther encode the semantics of coordination in each case. For this paper, we show this for VP coordi- nation only. In order to define VP coordination, we first define an auxiliary object AN D: (13) AN D : A:LT ype. x, y:A. a:A. p:A P rop. p(a) p(x) p(y). The auxiliary entities read as follows: for any type A in LT ype and forall x, y:A, AN D(A, (x, y)) is a 6 See (Chatzikyriakidis and Luo, 2012) for more details on the universe LT ype, its motivation as well as (some of) its in- troduction rules. 42 pair (a, f ) such that forall p:A P rop, f (p) is a proof that p(a) implies both p(x) and p(y). Then, and is defined as the first projection 1 of the auxil- iary object: (14) and = A:LT ype.x, y, z:A. 1 (AN D(A, x, y)) With these in mind, let us now look at the ex- isting proposal as regards dot-types and its proper formalization as this was provided in (Luo, 2010). The whole idea of forming a dot-type is informally based on the fact that to form a dot-type A B, its constituent types A and B should not share com- mon parts/components. For example, the following two cases cannot be dot-types since they both share components: (15) PHY PHY (16) PHY (PHY INFO) Definition 3.1 (components) Let T : T ype be a type in the empty context. Then, C(T ), the set of components of T , is defined as: C(T ) = df SUP(T ) if the NF of T is not X Y C(T 1 ) C(T 2 ) if the NF of T is T 1 T 2 where SUP(T ) = {T | T T }. The rules for the dot-types are given in Figure 1, as given in (Luo, 2012b). The notion of dot-type captures copredication in a nice way: it is both for- mal and suitable for MTT-semantics. The question is whether this account gives us correct individua- tion criteria. In order to test this, we check it against the Coq proof-assistant (The Coq team, 2007), based on the formal development as considered in (Luo, 2011). In effect, we define in Coq the dot-type PHY INFO and define Book to be the -type that encodes Pustejovksys qualia structure; as a conse- quence, Book is a subtype of PHY INFO. We fur- ther define mastered and picked up to be of type INFO P rop and PHY P rop, respectively, and further provide a tactic to enhance automation, the details of which are out of the scope of this paper. Lastly, the quantifier three is defined. 7 7 T hree is defined as follows: forall A of type CN and given a predicate P :A P rop, there exist three elements, x,y and z, that are different, which are true of P .

With these in line, let us see whether the correct predictions are being made with respect to individ- uation criteria. What we need to capture is the fol- lowing entailment: (17) John picked up and mastered three books John picked up three books and John mastered three books Basically, what we need to be able to get is a sit- uation where three distinct informational as well as 43 </chunk></section><section><heading>Formation Rule </heading><chunk>valid A : T ype B : T ype C(A) C(B) = A B : T ype </chunk></section><section><heading>Introduction Rule </heading><chunk>a : A b : B A B : T ype a, b : A B Elimination Rules c : A B p 1 (c) : A c : A B p 2 (c) : B </chunk></section><section><heading>Computation Rules </heading><chunk>a : A b : B A B : T ype p 1 (a, b) = a : A a : A b : B A B : T ype p 2 (a, b) = b : B Projections as Coercions A B : T ype A B &lt; p 1 A : T ype A B : T ype A B &lt; p 2 B : T ype Coercion Propagation A B : T ype A B : T ype A &lt; c 1 A : T ype B = B : T ype A B &lt; d 1 [c 1 ] A B : T ype where d 1 [c 1 ](x) = c 1 (p 1 (x)), p 2 (x).

Figure 1: The rules for dot-types. 44 physical objects are involved. We formulate this as a theorem to be proven in Coq: Theorem DT:(Three Book)(and(PhyInfo -&gt;Prop)(picked_up John)(mastered John))-&gt;(Three Book)(picked_up John)/\(Three Book)(mastered John). This can be proven in Coq. 8 Indeed, what we need with respect to examples like (22), as Gotham (2012) mentions, is an interpretation were the two objects are double distinct, both informationally and physically. Gotham (2012) shows this in discussing the account as proposed by (Asher, 2011), which provides weaker semantics for this example. In effect, Ashers (2011) account predicts situations where three informational and one physical object are involved (or vice versa) to be possible. The idea developed is roughly as follows: In every situation like (22) the hearer has to option to choose between the physical and the informational individuation cri- terion. If the former is chosen, then a situation where three physical objects but one informational object are involved is possible. If the hearer chooses the latter criterion, then a situation where three distinct informational objects but only one physical object is involved is possible. If this is true, one can in- deed use (22) to refer to let us say one informa- tional and three physical objects (or vice versa), then the double-distinct judgments should be the result of some pragmatic strengthening and thus should be cancelable. This is however not the case as the ex- amples below show (taken from Gotham, 2012): (18) John picked up and mastered three books, but he didnt pick up three books. (19) John picked up and mastered three books; in fact, he picked up exactly one book. (20) John picked up and mastered three books, but he didnt master three books. (21) John picked up and mastered three books; in fact, he mastered exactly one book. Most interestingly, what we can further prove is the entailment that from John picked up and mas- tered three books, it follows that John picked up 8 Those that wish to prove this on their own, the tactics to prove both of the examples are: compute, intro, destruct AN D, case a with (T hreeBook), AU T O, AU T O. three physical objects and mastered three informa- tional objects. In Coq notation: Theorem DT:(Three Book)(and(PhyInfo -&gt;Prop)(picked_up John)(mastered John))-&gt;(Three Phy)( picked_up John) /\(Three Info)(mastered John). This can be proven as well. 9 It seems in this respect, that the account gives the correct predictions as regards individuation cri- teria and counting. This can be seen as an advan- tage compared to approaches like Ashers (2011), which gives the correct results after some additional assumptions on accommodation are made (which really complicate the account), while they further make it too permissive as to allow the following (see (Gotham, 2014)): (22) # Fred picked up and mastered a stone. On the other hand, the claim made by (Gotham, 2014) that the dot-type account as this is given by (Luo, 2010) cannot capture the facts, is shown to be incorrect on the basis of what we have pre- sented here. Gothams account predicts the cor- rect results as well, but we believe at the expense of additional complications (e.g. the introduction of R compressible pluralities), that the present ac- count does not introduce. Thus, the account proposed for dot-types is not only formally sound but also gives the correct re- sults with respect to counting and individuation cri- teria without the need of additional machinery. We take this to be a clear advantage over the other ac- counts. On a more general level, it seems that using the rich typing structures that MTTs have to offer, provides us with considerable advantages over prob- lematic issues in lexical semantics. </chunk></section><section><heading>4 The Case of newspaper: a Proposal for Linear Dot-types </heading><chunk>Cases like book or lunch, being subtypes of dot- types, seem to have clear properties that are captured 9 In order to prove this, one has to add an additional axiom in Coq that deals with equalities under subtyping. In general, when X &lt;c Y , we do not have x =X y = (x =Y y) unless c is injective. For the atomic types like Book and PHY, the equality on a subtype coincides with that of the supertype and so we can axiomatically assume this. See Appendix A for the Coq code and some explanation. 45 with the existing formalization given for dot-types. There is however a more problematic case, famously exemplified by the word newspaper, which seem to require a different, more restrictive treatment. First of all, newspaper is associated with three rather than two senses, i.e. institution (23), informational object (24) and physical object (25) as the examples below illustrate: 10 (23) The newspaper was sued on moral grounds. (24) He read the newspaper. (25) He picked up the newspaper. Now, when it comes to the use of two different senses in the context of the same sentence, a num- ber of strange restrictions appear. The physical ob- ject sense can be used along with the informational sense, in the same way as in the case of book, but the organizational sense (newspaper as an institution) cannot be used copredicatively with any of the other two senses (examples from (Antunes and Chaves, 2003)): 11 (26) # That newspaper is owned by a trust and is covered with coffee. (27) # The newspaper fired the reporter and fell off the table. 10 An anonymous reviewer asks whether there are other anal- ogous cases with three-way polysemy. Words similar to news- paper also exist, e.g. magazine, journal. Other cases with more than two meaning are mentioned in (Retor  e, 2014) but it is not clear whether they constitute examples of a similar phe- nomenon. For example, the case of Liverpool, mentioned in (Retor  e, 2014) as having the senses Place, Town and People. It is not however clear whether the justification for these types is well-founded. For example the sense Town and People could be very well reduced into one sense. Unfortunately, this needs discussion that we cannot perform in this paper. However, this is an extremely important question and the range of examples that are similar to newspaper should be investigated in order to end up with a fuller classification of dot-types according to their properties. 11 As an anonymous reviewer notes, all these examples in- volve a conjunction of the organizational and the physical as- pect. He further asks what happens in case we have a conjunc- tion of the informational and the organizational aspect. These cases are also infelicitous, e.g. # He mastered and sued the newspaper or # That newspaper is owned by a trust and is very badly written, so the pattern described in the paper is not vio- lated. (28) # John sued and ripped the newspaper. Similar words with multiple senses that further in- volve similar restrictions are also discussed in (Re- tor  e, 2014). There, a multi-sorted higher order logic is used 12 and every word is associated with a kind of basic type along with a number of coercions that can coerce this basic type into additional types. So in the case of book one gets the principal lambda-term x.const(x):v t where v stands for event and two optional lambda-terms, Id:v v and f a :v a where a stands for type artifact, a subtype of physi- cal objects. The optional terms are declared as rigid, meaning that if one of the coercions is used, the other one cannot and vice versa. For the case of dot-types like book the optional lambda terms are dubbed as flexible, meaning that the coercions can be used simultaneously. This is indeed an interest- ing account. However, the exact nature of the rigid and flexible coercions are not defined formally, and it is rather unclear how such a specification can be made. Furthermore, for cases like newspaper, such an approach will not work. This is because, in the case of the coercion from f a :a i (artifact to in- formational object), this has to be defined as both rigid and flexible at the same time. Flexible, because we want this to be possible with the physical sense, while rigid because we want this not to be possi- ble with the organizational sense. Furthermore, the account is based on the idea that there is always a principal lambda term. For example, in the case of Book the physical sense is chosen. How is this sense chosen is something that it is not explained. The question of why the physical rather than the infor- mational aspect is chosen as the principal sense is something that is left unanswered. The data with respect to newspaper get further complicated. As we have seen, the organizational aspect cannot be used with any of the other two aspects. However, this is not without exceptions. There are cases this restriction seems to disappear, allowing the organizational aspect to appear with any of the two other senses: 12 The meta-language for the system in (Retor  e, 2014) is Gi- rards system F rather than the simply typed -calculus as in Churchs simple type theory (Church, 1940) as used by Mon- tague. 46 (29) The newspaper you are reading is being sued by Mia. However, if one looks at the examples that allow this kind of constructions, it seems that they are of a specific kind. Most specifically all these cases involve some kind of modification, e.g. a relative clause as in the above example, or adjectival modifi- cation as in (30): (30) The most provocative newspaper of the year has been sued by the government. (31) The newspaper he just grabbed from the news- stand is doing well in the stock market. The pattern seems to be the following: the or- ganizational aspect cannot be used with any of the other two aspects, unless one aspect is taking part in a modified CN construction. In case this happens the organizational aspect can be used along the other aspects. The account as proposed in (Pustejovsky, 1995) for newspaper cannot deal with these phe- nomenon and as far as we know, no formal account has been proposed for these cases. This is what we want to discuss here. The original account of dot- types in (Luo, 2010) among others will face similar problems. The dot-type INST (PHY INFO) will suffer the problem of predicting examples (23)-(25) to be ok contrary to fact. In what follows, we dis- cuss a solution to this extent by proposing to treat these cases by extending the dot-type system to fur- ther include resource sensitive dot-types, i.e. linear dot-types. Linear Dot-types: a Tentative Proposal. It is clear from what we see from the data that we are dealing with a situation where the dot-type is re- source sensitive, in the sense of linear logic (Girard, 1987) or Lambek calculus (Lambek, 1958). For ex- ample, in linear logic, the rules of weakening and contraction are not available and this has a num- ber of consequences. One of them is that one is has to use an assumption exactly once. An assump- tion, once used, is not re-usable anymore. It seems that this idea, is quite close to what we need for the newspaper case. 13 We need an additional version of the dot-type, more specifically a linear version of the dot-type. This version will be closed related to the tenser product in linear logic and the usual dot-type, one of the important feature being that if one of its components has been used, the other one cannot be used any more. Let us represent this linear dot-type as A B. We can further have combinations of regular and linear dot-types. In the case of newspaper what we need is the type INST (PHY INFO). With this type, we can take care of examples like (23) to (25) (these are also taken care of with a regular dot-type), while at the same time excluding examples (26-28) (that would be predicted to be ok with a regular dot-type). Note that the examples like (29) can be accounted for without employing the linear version of dot- types. For instance, the semantics of (29) can be given as sue(n) where n : (N ewpaper, read) and sue : Inst P rop, because we have (N ewpaper, read) &lt; N ewspaper &lt; INST (PHY INFO) &lt; INST. The question of course is when do we use a linear dot-type and when a regular dot-type. In order to solve this problem, one can use local coercions, i.e. subtyping assumptions local- ized in terms (or judgments), as proposed in (Luo, 2010; Luo, 2012b). Local coercions have been used in (Luo, 2011) to deal with cases of homophony and in (Asher and Luo, 2012) to give semantics of lin- guistic coercions in sophisticated situations. Local coercions are only effective locally for some terms (expressions in type theory). They may be intro- duced into terms by the following rule (intuitively, the coercions declared locally are only effective in the expressions in the scope of the keyword in): , A &lt; c B J coercion A &lt; c B in J where J is any of the following four forms of judge- ment: k : K, k = k : K, K kind, and K = K . For instance, with J k : K, we have , A &lt; c B k : K coercion A &lt; c B in k : K 13 This is based on the fact that in case the organizational as- pect is used, no other aspect can be used any more within the same context. This is a kind of resource sensitivity. 47 In the case of newspaper, what we need is to consider two local coercions: N ewspaper &lt; INST (PHY INFO) in inter- preting the cases where the ordinary dot-type should be used and N ewspaper &lt; INST (PHY INFO) in interpreting the cases where the linear dot-type should be used. For example, the following (32) will give a correct interpretation of (29): (32) coercion N ewspaper &lt; INST (PHY INFO) in [[(29)]] while the following would not be accepted: (33) # coercion N ewspaper &lt; INST (PHY INFO) in [[(26)]] We believe that this gives a satisfactory account of a problem that as far as we know has not received a treatment up to now. 14 However, it has to be kept in mind that we have not formally treated the linear dot-type A B. One of the reasons for this is that, in order to do this, we need to formally study how to incorporate coercive subtyping into a resource sensitive logical system. Put in another way, one needs to study an MTT aug- mented with resource sensitive contextual segments and its coercive subtyping extension. We leave this as future work. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Conclusion </heading><chunk>We have discussed dot-types with respect to their counting criteria and have shown that the MTT ac- count proposed captures the fact correctly. The proof-assistant Coq was used in order to verify that the correct inferences are predicted. The account was shown not only to produce the correct results but to do so without resorting to serious extra com- plications of the original account (actually none is 14 Another solution that has been proposed to us by an anony- mous reviewer, is the following: One basically assumes that the organizational aspect is just a different lexical entry, in effect as we understand it (even though the reviewer has not phrased it in this way) a case of homonymy. We have thought of this possibility. In case this idea is put forth within the framework discussed in this paper, one will use the account by (Luo, 2011) for cases of homonymy like bank where local coercions are used to either use Bank &lt; Institution or the Bank &lt; Riverside sense. In the case of newspaper, we would use either N ewspaper &lt; INST or N ewspaper &lt; PHY INFO. needed). Furthermore, the case of newspaper was discussed and a solution based on the introduction of linear dot-types combined with local coercions was provided. The issue of introducing linear dot-types in a formal way presupposes a linear version of type theory that at the moment we do not have. Thus, we leave this issue as a subject of future research. A related piece of work is that the second author has recently developed Lambek dependent types (Luo, 2015), with the motivation of studying a uniform ba- sis for NL analysis: from automated syntactic anal- ysis to logical reasoning in proof assistants based on MTT-semantics. </chunk></section><section><heading>References </heading><chunk>S.
