As with earlier CMCL meetings, CMCL 2015 provided a venue to support a broad spectrum of computational psycholinguistic inquiry. This year, we were pleased to receive fifteen submissions, ten of which were selected for final presentation at the workshop and are included in these proceedings. The submissions this year were exceptionally strong and reviewers commented that many of them could easily have been accepted as main conference submissions. We would like to thank all submitting authors for the quality and variety of the papers we received, and we would like to thank the program committee for their time, expertise, and insightful comments on the submissions. Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, The Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences at The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Department of Linguistics, we were able to obtain invited speakers and provide travel grants to a number of student authors. We extend our appreciation to our invited speakers, Dr. Andrew Kehler of the University of California, San Diego and Dr. Mark Steedman of the University of Edinburgh, for sharing their work with us. Thanks to everyone for your continued support of this workshop and for helping to foster the growth of the field of computational psycholinguistics.
