Health documents encompass electronic health records, clinical guidelines, spontaneous reports for pharmacovigilance, biomedical literature, health forums/blogs or any other type of health related documents. The Louhi workshop series fosters interactions between the Computational Linguistics, Medical Informatics and Artificial Intelligence communities. It started in 2008 in Turku, Finland and has been organized five times: Louhi 2010 was co-located with NAACL in Los Angeles, CA; Louhi 2011 was co-located with Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME) in Bled, Slovenia; Louhi 2013 was held in Sydney, Australia during NICTA Techfest; and Louhi 2014 was co-located with EACL in Gothenburg, Sweden. The aim of the Louhi 2015 workshop is to bring together research work on topics related to text mining of health documents, particularly emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of health documentation and the interplay between nursing and medical sciences, information systems, computational linguistics and computer science. The topics include, but are not limited to, the following Natural Language Processing techniques and related areas: Techniques supporting information extraction, e.g. named entity recognition, negation and uncertainty detection Classification and text mining applications (e.g. diagnostic classifications such as ICD-10 and nursing intensity scores) and problems (e.g. handling of unbalanced data sets) Text representation, including dealing with data sparsity and dimensionality issues Domain adaptation, e.g. adaptation of standard NLP tools (incl. tokenizers, PoS-taggers, etc) to the medical domain Information fusion, i.e. integrating data from various sources, e.g. structured and narrative documentation Unsupervised methods, including distributional semantics Evaluation, gold/reference standard construction and annotation Syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis of health documents Anonymization / de-identification of health records and ethics Supporting the development of medical terminologies and ontologies Individualization of content, consumer health vocabularies, summarization and simplifi- cation of text iii NLP for supporting documentation and decision making practices Predictive modeling of adverse events,e.g. adverse drug events and hospital acquired in- fections The call for papers encouraged authors to submit papers describing substantial and completed work but also focus on a contribution, a negative result, a software package or work in progress. We also encouraged to report work on low-resourced languages, addressing the challenges of data sparsity and language characteristic diversity. We received 39 submissions, an unprecedented high number for the LOUHI series. Each sub- mission went through a double-blind review process which involved three program committee members. Based on comments and rankings supplied by the reviewers, we accepted 19 papers (11 long papers and 8 short papers). The overall acceptance rate is 49% and the acceptance rate for long papers is 50%. During the workshop, 8 papers have been presented orally, and 11 papers have been presented as posters. Finally, we would like to thank the members of the program committee for the quality of theirs reviews in a very short period. We are very grateful to Marie-Francine Moens for accepting to give an invited talk. We would also like to thank the authors for their submissions and the quality of their work.
