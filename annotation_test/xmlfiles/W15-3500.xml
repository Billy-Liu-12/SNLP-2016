Eighth Street Stroudsburg, PA 18360 USA Tel: +1-570-476-8006 Fax: +1-570-476-0860 acl@aclweb.org ISBN 978-1-941643-61-7 ii Preface We are very pleased to welcome you to the 1st Workshop on Semantics-Driven Statistical Machine Translation (S 2 MT) in conjunction with ACL, held on July 30, 2015 at Beijing, China. Over the last two decades, statistical machine translation (SMT) has made a substantial progress from word-based to phrase and syntax-based SMT. Recently the progress curve has reached a stage where translation quality increases more slowly even if we use sophisticated syntactic forest-based models for translation. On the other hand, crucial meaning errors, such as incorrect translations of word senses and semantic roles, are still pervasive in SMT-generated translation hypotheses. These errors sometimes make the meanings of target translations significantly drift from the original meanings of source sentences. With an eye on the current dilemma of SMT, one might ask questions: Does SMT reach the maturity stage of its lifespan? Or is it time for us to find a new direction for SMT in order to catalyse next breakthroughs? Semantics-driven SMT may be one of these breaking points. Semantics at different levels may enable SMT to generate not only grammatical but also meaning-preserving translations. Lexical semantics provides useful information for sense and semantic role disambiguation during translation. Compositional semantics allows SMT to generate target phrase and sentence translations by means of semantic composition. Discourse semantics captures inter-sentence dependencies for document-level machine translation. Large-scale semantic knowledge bases such as WordNet, YAGO and BabelNet, can provide external semantic knowledge for SMT. Semantics-driven SMT allows us to gradually shift from syntax to semantics and offers insights on how meaning is correctly conveyed during translation. The goals of this workshop are to identify key challenges of exploring semantics in SMT, to discuss how semantics can help SMT and how SMT can benefit from rapid developments of semantic technologies theoretically and practically, and to find new opportunities emerging from the combination of semantics and SMT. Our key interest is to provide insights into semantics-driven SMT. Specifically, the motivations of this workshop are: To bring researchers in the SMT and semantics community together and to cultivate new ideas for cutting-edge models and algorithms of semantic SMT. To theoretically examine what semantics can provide for SMT and how SMT can benefit from semantics from a broad perspective. To explore new research horizons for semantics-driven SMT in practice. We received 8 submissions from Asia, Europe and USA. After a rigorous selection, we only accepted 4 high-quality papers in the workshop program. The accepted papers examine and explore semantics in machine translation from different angles and perspectives. Alastair Butler studies the round-trip transformations between parsed sentences and meaning representations. Elior Sulem, Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport investigate semantic annotations in contrast to syntactic annotations using French- English language pair as a case study. Jinan Xu, Jiangming Liu, Yufeng Chen, Yujie Zhang, Fang Ming and Shaotong Li incorporate case frames into hierarchical phrase-based Japanese-Chinese translation. Ales Tamchyna, Chris Quirk and Michel Galley present an abstract meaning representation to string translation model in a discriminative framework. In addition to the accepted papers, we are very delighted to invite 4 distinguished keynote speakers from semantics and machine translation to cover topics that cross boundaries of these two areas. Percy Liang (Stanford University) and Gerard de Melo (Tsinghua University) will give talks in the morning session, iii which connect semantic parsing and multilingual semantics to machine translation. Quoc V. Le (Google) will give a talk on neural language understanding in the afternoon session. Finally, Antonio Branco (University of Lisbon) will present high-quality translation via deep language engineering approaches. The workshop also features a panel on Semantics and Statistical Machine Translation: Gaps and Challenges at the end of the program. We invite Eduard Hovy, Percy Liang, Antonio Branco, Quoc V. Le and Chris Quirk as our panel speakers. Semantics-driven machine translation is an emerging and inter-disciplinary direction, which is still in its infancy. The panel discussion will shed light on the future practices and roadmap of semantics-driven machine translation research. This is the first time that the workshop is held. The success of the workshop relies on a plenty of colleagues involved in this event. We would like to thank the whole Program Committee (30 members) for their invaluable and generous efforts on reviewing the papers this year. We are also very grateful to our invited keynote and panel speakers. Special thanks goes to Prof. Eduard Hovy who suggested the topic of the panel discussion. Additionally, we would like to thank all authors who submitted papers to the workshop. Finally, we acknowledge the general support from our sponsors NiuTrans and the National Science Foundation of China and Jiangsu Province (grants No. 61403269 and BK20140355).

In this talk, I will present three ways in which semantic parsing relates to machine trans- lation: First, semantic parsing can be viewed *as* a translation task with many of the familiar issues, e.g., divergent hierarchical structures. Second, I discuss recent work in which semantic parsing is tackled *via* translation (more accurately, paraphrasing) techniques, where original sentences are mapped into canonical sentences encoding the logical form. Finally, I will dis- cuss ways in which semantic parsing could be useful *for* translation. Hopefully, this talk will open a deeper dialogue between the semantic parsing and machine translation communities and generate some fresh perspectives on semantics and translation.

Still, high-quality semantic analysis of text has to date been a rather elusive goal. Fortunately, unprecedented amounts of Big Data are now readily available via the Web. While genuine semantic interpretation remains challenging, these large quantities of data enable us to develop systems that are more robust and cover a much wider range of concepts and phenomena than those of the past. Expanding on this idea, I present a series of results on how we can develop systems that learn from Big Data in order to derive better semantic analyses, which in turn have the potential to improve machine translation. These show that it is possible to learn representations that inherit some of the benefits of language-neutral interlingua-like forms, yet preserve language-specific subtleties. One notable example is UWN (de Melo and Weikum, 2009), a highly multilingual lexical re- source allowing us to better cope with lexical gaps and generalize from observed translations. Another one is MENTA, a multilingual knowledge graph describing millions of names and words in over 200 languages in a semantic hierarchy. The WebChild project (Tandon et al., 2014) mines large amounts of common-sense knowl- edge from the Web, for instance, that salad is edible and that dogs are capable of barking. This sort of knowledge extracted from text can additionally be injected into word2vec-style distributed vector representations of words (Chen and de Melo, 2015). Finally, efforts such as FrameBase (Rouces et al., 2015) harmonize different ways of expressing relationships both in knowledge bases and in text ( Culo and de Melo, 2012). Biography Gerard de Melo is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing, where he is heading the Web Mining and Language Technology group. He has published over 50 research papers in these areas, being awarded Best Paper awards at CIKM 2010, ICGL 2008, and the NAACL 2015 Workshop on Vector Space Modeling, as well as an ACL 2014 Best Paper Honorable Mention, a Best Student Paper Award nomination at ESWC 2015, and the WWW 2011 Best Demonstration Award, among others. Prior to joining Tsinghua, de Melo had viii spent two years as a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley, working in ICSIs AI/FrameNet group. He received his doctoral degree at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany. He serves on the Editorial Boards of IEEE Collective Intelligence and of the Language Science Press TMNLP book series.

Le Google qvl@google.com Abstract Most language understanding problems can be formulated as a variable-length input and variable- length output prediction problem. In this talk, I will present a neural network framework to deal with this problem. Our framework makes use of recurrent networks to read in the input sequence of word vectors and predict the output sequence, one token at a time. On our benchmark with WMT14 our method is as good as with state-of-art phrase based translation methods. I will also present results applying this method to model conversations and generate captions for images. Biography Quoc V.

Further chances of success can thus be explored by machine translation sys- tems that are based on deeper semantic engineering approaches. Deep language processing has its stepping-stone in linguistically principled methods and gener- alizations. It has been evolving towards supporting realistic applications, namely by embedding more data based solutions, and by exploring new types of datasets recently developed, such as parallel DeepBanks. This progress is further supported by recent advances in terms of lexical processing. These advances have been made possible by enhanced techniques for referential and conceptual ambi- guity resolution, and supported also by new types of datasets recently developed as linked open data. In this talk, I will be reporting on the collective work done in the QTLeap project. This is a project that explores novel ways for attaining machine translation of higher quality that we believe are opened by a new generation of increasingly sophisticated semantic datasets and by recent advances in deep language processing.
