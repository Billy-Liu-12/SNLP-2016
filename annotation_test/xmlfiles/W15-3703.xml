In this paper, we propose a weakly super- vised approach based on Weighted Person- alized PageRank (WPPR) to create a sen- timent lexicon for classical Chinese po- etry. We evaluate our lexicon intrinsically and extrinsically. We show that our graph- based approach outperforms a previous well-known PMI-based approach (Turney and Littman, 2003) on both evaluation set- tings. On the basis of our sentiment lexi- con, we analyze sentiment in the Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry. We extract top- ics associated with positive (negative) sen- timent using a position-aware sentiment- topic model. We further compare senti- ment among different poets in Tang Dy- nasty (AD 618 907). </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>Classical Chinese poetry is a precious cultural her- itage. Among its over 3,000 years of history, the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 907) is widely viewed as the zenith of the art of classical Chinese poetry. The Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry, edited during the Qing Dynasty (1644 1911), contains over 42,860 poems in 900 volumes by more than 2,500 poets. The collection provides a magnificent insight into all aspects of social life of that period. Research on sentiment/emotion and imagery analysis of Tang poetry is an active subfield in Chinese philology, with a vast literature (Watson, 1971; Kao and Mei, 1971; Kao and Mei, 1978). In this paper, we seek to analyze the sentiment (i.e., positive or negative) of textual elements in Tang poetry from a computational perspective. Specif- ically, we propose a novel graph-based method to create a sentiment lexicon for classical Chinese poetry. Such a lexicon is a valuable resource for other computational research on classical Chinese poetry, such as semantic analysis (Lee and Tak- sum, 2012) or poetry generation (He et al., 2012; Zhang and Lapata, 2014). Turney and Littman (2003) propose a PMI- based algorithm to estimate the semantic orien- tation or polarity of a word. The semantic ori- entation of a given word is calculated by com- paring its similarity to positive reference words (e.g., excellent or beautiful) with its similarity to negative reference words (e.g., poor or bad). In- stead of calculating the similarity between a given word and each of the positive (negative) reference words separately, we apply Weighted Personalized PageRank (WPPR) to measure the similarity be- tween the given word and all positive (negative) reference words simultaneously in a lexical net- work that we build from a poetry corpus. Our graph-based method is able to find globally opti- mal solution because the lexical network is ana- lyzed as a whole (Section 3). We evaluate our poetry sentiment lexicon intrin- sically and extrinsically. For the intrinsic eval- uation, we compile two test datasets. The first dataset contains 933 words (532 positive and 401 negative) taken from three Chinese sentiment lexi- cons 1 . The second dataset contains 55 words taken from literature of imagery analysis for Tang po- etry. These words reflect the common imageries in classical Chinese poetry and have certain fixed emotional connotations. For instance, the char- acter (ape) often relates to sadness, anxi- ety and distress, while the character (lotus) 1 Although these lexicons are for contemporary Chinese, some words keep the same meaning and polarity as in classi- cal Chinese poetry. 15 is the symbol of beauty, love and rectitude. We show that our method outperforms the very com- petitive PMI-based approach when evaluating on both datasets (Section 4.1). Our method also out- performs the baseline on an extrinsic evaluation task of predicting sentiment orientation of classi- cal Chinese poetry (Section 4.2). On the basis of our sentiment lexicon, we ana- lyze sentiment in the Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry. We first analyze topic distributions under positive/negative sentiment in Tang poetry using a position-aware sentiment-topic model (Section 5.1). We then compare sentiment among different poets in Tang Dynasty (Section 5.2). The main contributions of our work are: We propose a graph-based method to build a sentiment lexicon for classical Chinese po- etry. Our method is weakly supervised and does not rely on existing lexical resources (e.g., WordNet). It can be easily ported to other domains/languages. We evaluate our sentiment lexicon systemat- ically and demonstrate that it can be utilized to analyze sentiment orientation of classical Chinese poetry. We analyze sentiment in Tang poetry on the basis of our sentiment lexicon. We apply a position-aware sentiment-topic model to extract themes which are tightly associated with positive/negative sentiment. Our model builds in specific assumptions that character- ize sentiment expression in classical Chinese poetry. It assumes that lexical items from the same region are generated from a single sentiment-topic pair. We compare sentiment among different famous poets and show that our results are in accordance with studies in Chinese philology. The poetry sentiment lexicon described in the paper as well as all test datasets are freely available at http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg. de/ hou/resources.mhtml. 2 Related Work Sentiment lexicons. In recent years, consider- able attention has been given to the creation of large polarity (positive and negative) lexicons, in- cluding various corpus-based approaches (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Kiritchenko et al., 2014) and dictionary-based approaches (Kamps et al., 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Mohammad et al., 2009; Baccianella et al., 2010). Unlike previous graph-based approaches which create sentiment lexicons based on existing lexi- cal resources (e.g., WordNet, thesauri) (Takamura et al., 2005; Rao and avichandran, 2009; Hassan et al., 2011), there are no such lexical resources for classical Chinese poetry. Therefore, we choose a corpus-based approach. While our approach for building sentiment lexi- cons is domain independent, in this paper we apply it to classical Chinese poetry. This is not a triv- ial task. There are a variety of reliable resources for English sentiment analysis. However, only a few sentiment lexicons for Chinese are available. In particular, these lexicons are for contemporary Chinese. Moreover, given that these lexicons are developed for contemporary Chinese, they will only have partial coverage for classical Chinese poetry. There might also be divergences due to the change of language over several thousand years. To improve sentiment analysis for Chinese, one line of work seeks to leverage rich English senti- ment resources through machine translation (Wan, 2008; Wan, 2009; He et al., 2010). These ap- proaches depend on the quality of machine trans- lation and translation of classical Chinese poetry to English is hard even for professional transla- tors. Our work is similar to Zagibalov and Car- roll (2008) in the sense that both approaches are weakly supervised. They build a sentiment lexi- con iteratively, starting from a small set of seed items and several lexical patterns (negated adver- bial constructions) which can indicate lexical po- larity. However, such lexical patterns (e.g., (not) (quite) + (satisfied) (target word) ) are not applicable in classical Chinese poetry. Computational analysis of classical Chinese po- etry. There has been previous work focusing on classical Chinese poetry generation (Zhou et al., 2010; He et al., 2012; Zhang and Lapata, 2014). Lee and Kong (2012) develop a dependency tree- bank for the Complete Anthology of Tang Po- etry. On the basis of this corpus, Lee and Tak-sum (2012) quantitatively analyze the semantic con- tent and word usage in the Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry. Voigt and Jurafsky (2013) find that the classical characters of Chinese poetry de- creased across the century by comparing classical 16 poetry and contemporary prose. There are only a few works trying to analyze sentiment in classical Chinese poetry. Hu (2001) proposes similarity search by using word asso- ciation measures. For instance, given typical emo- tional words such as (sadness) (sorrow), the system can find words (e.g., (southern shore, a place often used to hold farewell parties in ancient China) ) associated with sad emotions. However, he does not analyze sentiment in classi- cal Chinese poetry quantitatively. Based on manu- ally annotated data, Luo (2009) analyzes the senti- ment of classical Chinese Song poetry among dif- ferent poets. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available sentiment lexicon for clas- sical Chinese poetry. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Building a Sentiment Lexicon for Classical Chinese Poetry </heading><chunk>In this section, we briefly introduce Weighted Per- sonalized PageRank (WPPR). We then detail how we construct a lexical network and how we apply WPPR over the lexical network to build a senti- ment lexicon for classical Chinese poetry. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.1 Weighted Personalized PageRank </heading><chunk>The original PageRank algorithm was first intro- duced by Brin and Page (1998). It is a link- based algorithm for ranking the vertices in a graph. Later, various extensions have been proposed. Weighted PageRank (Xing and Ghorbani, 2004) takes into account the importance of both the in- links and the outlinks of the vertices when dis- tributing rank scores based on the popularity of the vertices. Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2002; White and Smyth, 2003) computes the im- portance of vertices in a graph relative to one or more root vertices. It has been successfully ap- plied in other NLP tasks, such as word sense dis- ambiguation (Agirre and Soroa, 2009). Here we combine Weighted PageRank and Per- sonalized PageRank to measure the similarity of lexical items in a lexical network relative to senti- ment seeds. Let G be a lexical network with N vertices v 1 , . . . , v n V and w ij be the weight associated with the edge from v i to v j . Let M be a N N transition probability matrix, where M ij = w ij if a link from v i to v j exists, and zero otherwise, let S be a set of sentiment seeds where S V . Then the Weighted Personalized PageR- ank vector R over G can be calculated as follows: R = M R + (1 )P, (1) where is the damping factor and its value usu- ally set in the [0.85..0.95] range. P is a N 1 vector, where P i = 1 |S| for v i S, and zero other- wise, i.e., all vertices in the sentiment seeds have equal prior probability. Equation 1 can be viewed as the result of a ran- dom walk process starting from the seed nodes, where the random walkers can jump back to the seed nodes S with a given probability 1 . The final rank of vertex v i , biased towards the set S (the bias is encoded in P ), represents the proba- bility of a random walk over the weighted graph (weights associated with edges are encoded in M ) ending on vertex v i , at a sufficiently large time. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.2 Lexical Network Construction </heading><chunk>To create a sentiment lexicon for classical Chinese poetry, we first build a lexical network on the ba- sis of the Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry 2 . Since poetry is imbued with emotions, we assume that: (1) each lexical items in the lexical network bears positive or negative sentiment; and (2) lexi- cal items within a small window are more likely to share the same sentiment. Therefore, by applying WPPR on the basis of a small set of positive (nega- tive) lexical items, we can trace how positive (neg- ative) sentiment information is distributed over the whole lexical network. The lexical network G is a directed weighted graph, where each vertex v i is a lexical item. We define a lexical item as a word containing one or two characters. Classical Chinese poetry is typi- cally written in a highly compressed style, where each line normally has a fixed five or seven char- acters. As a result, each character itself or words containing two characters are expressive and can be used as the main semantic units. Instead of car- rying out word segmentation, we simply use a fre- quency threshold to extract lexical items: a lexi- cal unit is extracted as a lexical item if it appears at least x times in the corpus (x is ten for single- character unit and 50 for two-character unit). We then create an edge from v i to v j , if v i and v j co-occur within a window of five characters, i.e., v i occurs within a window of five characters be- fore or after v j . Let f ij be the number of times </chunk></section><section><heading>2 The corpus can be downloaded from http://datatang.com </heading><chunk>17 that v i and v j co-occur in the whole corpus, we set the weight of the edge from v i to v j as follows: w ij = f ij N k=1 f ik (2) Alternatively, w ij can be viewed as the probabil- ity of lexical item v j occurring nearby, given the lexical item v i . As a result, we construct a lexical network containing 8656 lexical items (4779 are single- character items, 3877 are two-character items) and 8,832,234 edges. This lexical network contains the word co-occurrence information in the Com- plete Anthology of Tang Poetry. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.3 Sentiment Lexicon Creation </heading><chunk>We compile a small set of sentiment seeds, which contains six positive lexical items and six negative lexical items (see Table 1). These lexical items are frequent single characters in the Complete An- thology of Tang Poetry and carry strong sentiment. Similar to Turney and Littman (2003) who use 14 sentiment seeds (seven positive words and seven negative words), we only focus on a small number of sentiment seeds to study whether we can build a reasonable sentiment lexicon from weak super- vision. Characters positive (fragrant) (love) (happy) seeds (virtuous) (delight) (lucky) negative (cold) (anxiety) (lonely) seeds (painful) (sorrow) (resentment) Table 1: Positive and negative sentiment seeds. We apply WPPR (Section 3.1) twice over the lexical network described in Section 3.2, initial- ized with the positive seeds and negative seeds re- spectively. We follow the common practice of set- ting the damping factor to 0.85. Consequently, we get two PageRank vectors Rp and Rn. They can be seen as a measure of similarity of lexical items to all positive seeds and all negative seeds respec- tively. Finally, we calculate the sentiment vector as follows: Rs = Rp Rn (3) A lexical item i has a positive sentiment orienta- tion if its corresponding entry in vector Rs (hence Rs i ) is positive, and a negative sentiment orienta- tion if Rs i is negative. The value of Rs i can be viewed as the strength of the sentiment orientation associated with the lexical item i. </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Sentiment Lexicon Evaluation </heading><chunk>We evaluate our poetry sentiment lexicon intrin- sically and extrinsically. For the intrinsic evalua- tion, we utilize sentiment lexicons for contempo- rary Chinese because there is a partial overlap be- tween these lexicons and sentiment expressions in classical poetry. We also evaluate lexical items in our sentiment lexicon appearing only in classical poetry. In the extrinsic evaluation, we test whether our sentiment lexicon can be used to predict senti- ment orientation of classical Chinese poetry. </chunk></section><section><heading>4.1 Intrinsic Evaluation </heading><chunk>Test Datasets. To evaluate our approach, we compile two test datasets. The first dataset (Sen- tiLexicon) contains 933 sentiment words taken from three Chinese sentiment lexicons: HowNet 3 , NTUSD (Ku et al., 2006), and Tsinghua sentiment lexicon 4 . Although these lexicons are for contem- porary Chinese, some words keep the same mean- ing and polarity as in classical Chinese poetry. We merge these three lexicons by removing duplicate or contradictory entries. This yields a big senti- ment lexicon containing 12,945 positive words 5 and 17,114 negative words. We then create Sen- tiLexicon by choosing single-character words and two-character words from the big sentiment lexi- con if they do not appear in the set of sentiment seeds (Table 1) and occur at least 50 times 6 in the Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry. This leads to a dataset containing 532 positive lexical items and 401 negative lexical items. However, SentiLexicon does not reflect an im- portant aspect of classical Chinese poetry, i.e., emotions are expressed implicitly through im- agery. Skilled poets often apply concrete imagery to evoke emotions and sensations. Certain im- ageries have fixed emotional connotations. For example, the falling autumn leaf ( ) often refers to personal or dynastic decline. We call such words imagery words. We collect 55 typical im- agery words (ImageryLexicon) from literature of imagery analysis for Tang poetry. Every word in ImageryLexicon does not appear in SentiLexicon. Table 2 shows some examples of ImageryLexicon. 3 http://www.keenage.com/html/e index.html 4 http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/ lj/ 5 A word can contain one character or several characters. 6 We carried out preliminary experiments with the thresh- olds ranging from ten to 50. We found that the accuracy of our method varies in a small range, and our approach outper- forms the baseline at all threshold levels. 18 Characters positive (mandarin duck) (hibiscus) (phoenix) (orchid) (bamboo) negative (sycamore) (crow) (willow) (partridge) (sunset) (cuckoo) Table 2: Examples of ImageryLexicon.

Baseline. We reimplement a previous PMI- based approach (Turney and Littman, 2003) as the baseline. We use the same sentiment seeds and the same co-occurrence window of five characters as our method. The sentiment orientation of a lexi- cal item (single or two-character) is calculated as follows: SO (w) = spSeeds PMI (w, s) snSeeds PMI (w, s) (4) Results on test datasets. Table 3 shows the re- sults of our method described in Section 3 (WPPR) and the baseline (PMI) against two test datasets. Our graph-based approach outperforms the base- line in both cases. Our method is more robust than the baseline because it measures the similarity be- tween the candidate lexical item and the whole positive (negative) sentiment seeds together. Evaluation on sample data. Our test datasets (SentiLexicon and ImageryLexicon) only cover about 11.5% of lexical items of our sentiment lex- icon. To evaluate the lexical items that are not in the test sets, we randomly choose 100 items (50 single and 50 two-character lexical items, both with the equal positive/negative sentiment distri- bution). They were manually checked by the first author. We obtain an accuracy of 53% in this hard evaluation setting. </chunk></section><section><heading>4.2 Extrinsic Evaluation </heading><chunk>We also carry out an extrinsic evaluation to judge whether our sentiment lexicon can be utilized to analyze sentiment orientation of classical Chinese poetry. We choose 160 poems from the Tang po- etry analysis dictionary (Xiao, 1999), which con- tains around 1,000 Tang poems paired with pro- fessional reviews. We manually annotate the sen- timent of each poem as positive or negative ac- cording to the reviewers analysis. This leads to a dataset (sentiPoetry) containing 83 negative po- ems and 77 positive poems. For each poem, we predict its sentiment based on the accumulated sentiment orientations of all lexical items (single and two-character) in the poem. Specifically, a poem is predicted as positive if its accumulated sentiment orientation is bigger than a threshold t, and negative otherwise. A subset of sentiPoetry containing 30 positive poems and 30 negative po- ems is used to tune the threshold t, the remain- ing 100 poems are reserved as test data. Table 4 shows the accuracy of predicting poetry sentiment on the test dataset using the sentiment lexicon for contemporary Chinese described in Section 4.1, as well as the two lexicons based on the baseline (PMI) and our method (WPPR) respectively. Us- ing our lexicon achieves an accuracy of 71% on predicting poetry sentiment, which is 14% better than using PMI Lexicon. It is obvious that the Out- of-Domain lexicon (contemporarySenti Lexicon) performs the worst because of its low coverage of lexical items used in classical Chinese poetry. A closer look at the results indicates that positive po- ems are hard to predict because happy/joyful emo- tions are often expressed in a very subtle, implicit way.

But how are sen- timents expressed in different topics? How does sentiment differ between individual poets? We aim to answer these questions in this section. </chunk></section><section><heading>5.1 Sentiment-based Topic Distribution </heading><chunk>Position-aware sentiment-topic model. Tradi- tional topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) have been explored ex- tensively to discover topics from text. Recently, 19 LDA has been extended to capture correlations be- tween sentiment and topic from textual data (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Lin and He, 2009; He et al., 2011; Lazaridou et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013). Here we modify a joint sentiment-topic model (JST) (Lin and He, 2009) to extract topics asso- ciated with positive/negative sentiment. Lin and He (2009) assume that topics are generated depen- dent on sentiment distributions and words are gen- erated conditioned on the sentiment-topic pairs. JST can detect sentiment and topics simultane- ously by encoding word prior sentiment infor- mation. However, words in the JST model are position-unaware, i.e., words from the same sen- tence/clause thus can have different topics or sen- timents. We modify the JST model by assuming that lexical items from the same couplet are gen- erated conditioned on the same sentiment-topic pairs. In Chinese poetry, a couplet is a pair of lines which have the same length and express a complete meaning. Lexical items within the same couplet usually relate to the same topic and keep the same polarity. Our position-aware JST model is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Position-aware JST model. Assume we have a corpus consisting of D doc- uments; each document is a sequence of C cou- plets and each word (lexical item) in the couplet is an item from a vocabulary index with V distinct terms; let S be the number of distinct sentiment la- bels and T the total number of topics. The process of generating a word w in document d under our position-aware JST model is as follows: For each sentiment label l S and each topic j T , draw lj Dirichlet( l T lj ) For each document d, Draw the documents sentiment distri- bution d Dirichlet() For each sentiment label l, draw a topic distribution d,l Dirichlet() For each couplet, 1. choose a sentiment label l i M ultinomial( d ) 2. choose a topic z i M ultinomial( d,l i ) 3. generate words w l i ,z i Model Priors and hyperparameter settings. We incorporate our sentiment lexicon (described in Section 3) containing 4153 positive lexical items and 4503 negative lexical items as prior knowledge into the position-aware JST model. Specifically, if w is found in the sentiment lexi- con, then the element lw = 1, and zero other- wise. Following Lin and He (2009), we set the symmetric = 0.01, = (0.05 L)/S, where L is the average document length, S is the total num- ber of sentiment labels 7 . The asymmetric prior is learned from data. Topics under different sentiment polarities. We apply the position-aware sentiment-topic model to the Complete Anthology of Tang Po- etry. The corpus contains 42,862 poems written by 2630 authors, with an average of 60 single char- acters in each poem. We represent each poem as couplets containing single and two-character lex- ical items 8 . We conduct experiments on T = 15, 25, 50 respectively. Table 5 shows the topic ex- amples extracted by the position-aware sentiment- topic model with T = 25 under positive and nega- tive sentiment labels respectively. The topics are labeled manually according to the lexical items found in them. Each topic is represented by the top 15 lexical items. These topics reflect com- mon themes associated with positive/negative sen- timent in Tang poetry. Moreover, the sentiment- topic distribution provides us with more insight on different aspects of social life in that historical pe- riod of China (AD 618 907). For instance, poets wrote poems to praise the beauty of women and flowers (topic PT0 and 7 In our experiments, the value of is around 1.00. This means that we do not assume any prior knowledge of the sen- timent distribution of a poem and all possible sentiment dis- tributions are equal. 8 Similar to lexical network construction (Section 3.3), the two-character lexical items should appear at least 50 times in the whole corpus. 20 Positive Sentiment Topics Lexical items PT0: beautiful women (jade) (gold) (red) (silk) (perfume) (women) (green jade) (song) (dance) (building) (painting) (pearl) (eyebrow) (pair) (brocade) PT1: feast drinking (wine) (drunk) (song) (cup) (happy) (attentive) (guest) (face to face) (drink) (chord) (happy) (advise) (drink) (intoxicated) (feast) PT2: war victory (military) (banner) (banner) (horse) (general) (god) (sword) (ride) (bow) (army) (achievement) (banner) (arrow) (battle) (shoot) PT3: literary (poetry) (article) (letter) (reputation) (inscribe) (sentence) (gentleman) (character) (chapter) (gift) (article) (sing) (compose) (pen) (high) PT4: royal (moral) (god) (ritual) (music) (holy) (spirit) (bright) (great number) graciousness (only) (pay respect) (emperor) (emperor) (country) (achievement) (god) PT5: supernature (god) (jade) (vermilion) (god) (god) (rosy clouds) (violet) (spirit) (dragon) (mist) (god) (fairy) (clean) (fairyland) PT6: Buddhism (perfume) (meditation) (master) (heart) (world) (dharma) (clean) (truth) (lotus) (Taoism) (clean) (bell) (world) (scholar) (buddhism) PT7: traveling (building) (high) (go up) (climb) (hill) (travel) (province) (terrace) (south) (place name) (go down) (overlook) (beautiful) (clouds) (place name) PT8: flowers (perfume) (flower) (twig) (dew) (hibiscus) (peach) (light) (fragrant) (gentle) (delicate) (charming) (round) (fresh) (green jade) (orchid) Negative Sentiment Topics Lexical items NT0: lovesickness (farewell) (leave) (melancholy) (lovesick) (memorize) (hope) (meet) (hate) (farewell) (year) (gentleman) (dream) (remote) (return) (tears) NT1: hardness of life (old) (sickness) (many) (no) (gray) (temple hair) (no) (sing) (anxious) (feeble) (poor) (old age) (lie down) (more) (hard) NT2: hardness of war (fortress) (border) (city) (river) (barbarian) (barrier) (attack) (wind) (moon) (north) (battle) (snow) (captive) (garrison) (drum) NT3: traveling by boat (river) (water) (boat) (lake) (wave) (bank) (wave) (wind) (sand) (sail) (lonely) (sea) (boat) (riverside) (moon) NT4: homesickness (bear) (break) (home) (fall) (home) (sorrow) (anxious) (return) (tears) (road) (intestine, often used to describe heartbroken) (sad) (sad) (shore) (news) NT5: visiting monks (mountain) (monk) (pine) (temple) (rock) (forest) (deep) (fountain) (night) (cold) (search) (guest) (peak) (cloud) (stream) NT6: sad scenery (autumn) (wind) (leaf) (cold) (rain) (sunset) (evening) (water) (twilight) (frost) (chrysanthemum) (cicada) (mountain) (fall) (cold) NT7: sad scenery (rain) (ape) (gorge) (cry) (river) (clouds) (river name) (place name) (mountain) (twilight) (waste time) (gorge name) (clouds and rain) (dream) (mountain name) NT8: death and (death) (birth) (miserable) (bone) (sad) (hungry) (blood) (mud) destruction (kill) (withered) (thin and pallid) (ghost) (evil) (disaster) (dust) Table 5: Examples of topics extracted by the position-aware sentiment-topic model. PT8). They eulogized the Tang empire and were proud of the countrys victory in war (topic PT4 and PT2). They enjoyed drinking at banquet (topic PT1), admire others literary achievements (topic PT3) and praised beautiful landscapes while trav- eling (topic PT7). In addition, it seems that Bud- dhism and supernatural beings are the favored top- ics of poetry in the Tang Dynasty (topic PT6 and PT5). This might reflect that Buddhism was at its peak in the Tang Dynasty and many poets were devout Buddhists. On the other hand, poets felt sad for women who separated with their loved ones (topic NT0). They were angry for death and destruction caused by tyranny and turmoil (topic NT8). Poets were tired of war (topic NT2) and they were homesick while traveling alone (topic NT3 and NT4). It is worth noticing that some topics are asso- ciated with both positive and negative sentiment. For instance, poets were happy about the vic- tory of war (topic PT2). At the same time, they were sad about the destruction/pain caused by war (topic NT2), i.e., soldiers were forced to leave their homelands and loved ones. Also, traveling 21 could involve both sentiments: poets praised the beauty of nature (PT7); but they also felt lonely while traveling alone (NT3, NT4). Specifically, some scenes during traveling become common im- ageries/symbols which imply sad emotions, such as things related to water (i.e., (river), (boat), (lake), (wave), (bank), (sail), (wave), (riverside) in topic NT3), or (ape) in topic NT7. This also reflects that poets liked trav- eling and that traveling by boat was popular in the Tang Dynasty. </chunk></section><section><heading>5.2 Sentiment of Different Poets </heading><chunk>In order to analyze how sentiment differs among poets, we choose four famous poets from the Tang dynasty: (Li Bai), (Du Fu), (Wang Wei), and (Bai Juyi). Li Bai enjoys the title of the Supernatural Be- ing of Poem. His works are full of passion, imag- ination and elegance. Du Fu, known as the Poet Sage, is known for his anti-war stance and con- cerns for the poor. Wang Wei, the poet of land- scape, has written lots of elegant and exquisite po- ems. Bai Juyi has been known for his plain and easily comprehensible style of poem, and for his social and political criticism. Table 6 lists the po- ets lifetimes and the number of their poems col- lected in the Complete Anthology of Tang Poetry. Poet Lifetime Number of Poems (Li Bai) 701 762 891 (Du Fu) 712 770 1,151 (Wang Wei) 701 761 350 (Bai Juyi) 772 846 2,640 Table 6: Number of poems by chosen poets. On the basis of our sentiment lexicon, we pre- dict the sentiment orientation of each poem using the method described in Section 4.2 with threshold t = 0 9 . We then compare the percentage of poems with different sentiment for each poet. Figure 2 shows that the percentage of positive poems written by Li Bai is the highest among our four poets, whereas the percentage of nega- tive poems written by Du Fu is the highest 10 . It 9 We could also use our position-aware sentiment-topic model to predict the sentiment orientation of each poem. However, for the task of predicting sentiment orientation of poems, we found that the position-aware JST model does not perform as well as our simple method described in Section 4.2 on the same test dataset. 10 We find that the comparison under different value of t keeps the same pattern as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Sentiment of different poets. seems that Du Fu expressed sad emotions more frequently in his poems. This may relate to his frustrating experiences. He aspired a career as a civil servant, but his failure in the examination put an end to his chances to have an official ca- reer. During the period of political turmoil, Du Fu fled to the capital. But he was captured and then wandered as a refugee. Most of Du Fus life was spent in poverty. One of his sons even died from starvation because of the familys poverty. Du Fu wrote several poems to express his deep sadness for his sons death. It is worth noting that although Bai Juyi has been known for his critical political poems, he also wrote a great amount of poems expressing leisurely and comfortable mood, espe- cially in his late years. </chunk></section><section><heading>6 Conclusions </heading><chunk>We propose a novel graph-based method to build a sentiment lexicon for classical Chinese poetry. Our approach is weakly supervised and outper- forms a previous PMI-based approach (Turney and Littman, 2003) in different evaluation settings. On the basis of our sentiment lexicon, we analyze sen- timent in Tang poetry from different perspectives: which topics are associated with positive and neg- ative sentiment, and how sentiment is distributed among different poets. Our analysis results are in line with the main findings established in classical Chinese literary studies. The work presented in this paper provides a quantitative means to study sentiment in classi- cal Chinese poetry. We hope it can benefit other research topics, such as poetry generation (He et al., 2012; Zhang and Lapata, 2014) and poetry im- agery/style analysis (Fang et al., 2009). 22 References Eneko Agirre and Aitor Soroa. 2009.
