The algorithm the sentiment analysis system CUCsas adopts to perform this task includes three steps: (1) whether there is an exp (short for expression having evaluation meaning) in the weibo message; (2) whether there is a semantic orientation relationship between the exp and topic; (3) the sentiment polarity classification of the exp. CUCsas completes step (1) based on the sentiment lexicon and sentiment value assignment rules, completes step (2) based on the topic extrac- tion and sentiment polarity classification rule base, and completes step (3) based on the sentiment computing rules. Taking 20 given topics and a total of 19,469 weibo messages released by SIGHAN-2015 Bake-off as the test data, the overall F value of the rule-based system CUCsas is 0.69 in the unrestricted test. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Algorithm Description </heading><chunk>The locutionary subjectivity denotes the locutio- nary agents self-expression of cognition, feeling or perception in the use of language (John Lyons, 1995). And the evaluation is one type of locutio- nary subjectivity. An evaluation discourse con- sists of four basic elements: E(s) = {sub, obj, exp, com}. Herein, E(s) represents an evaluation discourse, and sub, obj, exp and com refers to the subject of evaluation, the object of evaluation, an expression having evaluation meaning, and other discourse components re- spectively (Zhou Hongzhao et al., 2014). The study of this paper is under the condition of knowing obj (= the given topic) in the weibo message, enabling the system automatically rec- ognize whether there is an exp in the same weibo message. If there is not, the system will output result [topic: 0]; if there is, the system will make a further identification that whether there is a semantic orientation relationship between the exp and the given topic. If there is not, the sys- tem will outputs result [topic 0]; if there is, the system will further classify the sentiment polarity of the exp. If it is positive, the system will output result [topic 1]; if it is negative, the system will output result [topic -1]; if it is neutral, the system will output result [topic 0]. Apparently, the algo- rithm is different from some widely used ma- chine learning sentiment polarity classification algorithms, such as Nai ve Bayes, Max Entropy, Boosted Trees and Random Forest (Amit Gupte et al., 2014). Figure 1 shows the algorithm of the the system of rule-based weibo messages senti- ment polarity classification towards given topics. Example (1) &lt;weibo&gt;: Galaxy S6 S6 Edge,&lt;/weibo&gt; (There is no exp in the weibo message. Output: 0) 149 Example (2) &lt;weibo&gt;:, ,//: GALAXY S6 &lt;/weibo&gt; (There are exps and in the weibo message. But there is no semantic orientation relationship between the exps and the given topic S6. Output: 0) Example (3) &lt;weibo&gt;: s6 , &lt;/weibo&gt; (There is an exp in the weibo message. There is a semantic orientation relationship between the exp and the given topic S6. The sentiment polarity of the exp is negative. Output: -1) Example (4) &lt;weibo&gt;:HTC One M9 S6 ?&lt;/weibo&gt; (There is an exp in the weibo message. There is a semantic orientation relationship between the exp and the given topic S6. The sentiment polarity of the exp is neutral in the weibo message context. Output: 0) Figure 1. The Algorithm of the Weibo Topic Sentiment Polarity Classification </chunk></section><section><chunk>2 The Automatic Recognition of the Exp in the Weibo Message  From the perspective of linguistics, the exp can be divided into three broad categories, including six specific types. (1) Category one &lt;1&gt; Type one: the context-free evaluation word or phrase Feature: Independent of context, it expresses positive or negative evaluation meaning by itself. Sentiment marker: po or ne Examples: Total in the sentiment lexicon: 26,042 (2) Category two: the context-sensitive evalua- tion word or phrase Feature: Whether it expresses evaluation meaning or not depends on the context. &lt;2&gt; Type two: the commendatory potential word Feature: When modified by the degree word, it can express positive evaluation meaning. Semantic marker: pxn Examples: man Total in the semantic lexicon: 51 &lt;3&gt; Type three: the derogatory potential word Feature: When modified by the degree word, it can express negative evaluation meaning. Semantic marker: nxn Examples: 2 Total in the semantic lexicon: 18 &lt;4&gt; Type four: the meaning-shifting noun Feature: When modified by the affirmative word such as or , it expresses positive evaluation meaning; when modified by the nega- tive word such as or , it expresses neg- ative evaluation meaning. Semantic marker: ypn Examples: Total in the semantic lexicon: 198 &lt;5&gt; Type five: the adjective of weights and measures Feature: When combined with the product attribute or human character word, the adjective of weights and measures, such as , can express evaluation meaning. Examples: +++ Total in the phrase rule base: 153 (3) Category three &lt;6&gt; Type six: Evaluation syntactical structure or distant collocation. Examples: ......;...... Total in the phrase rule base: 52 </chunk></section><section><chunk>2.1 The Storage and Formal Description of Different Types of Exps  (1) Words and phrases of type one are stored in the sentiment lexicon SentiDic.txt in the form of entries. The lexicon format and entry samples are as follows: 150 [Word or phrase Part of speech Positive sentiment intensity value Negative senti- ment intensity value] a 0.5 0 v 0 0.5 n 0 0.5 (2) Words and phrases of type two, three and four are stored in the semantic dictionary Usr- Di1.dic first. Then, corresponding sentiment val- ue assignment rules for them are formulated in the phrase rule base PhraseRule.txt. The lexicon format and entry samples: [Word or phrase Semantic marker] pxn nxn ypn The sentiment value assignment rule samples: 1 */mopo + */pxn = #2:0.75 The left part of = is the matching condition, the right part of = is the operation result. The symbol */mopo represents a degree modifier (e.g. ). The function of this rule: When there is a */mopo in front of */pxn, a 0.75 sentiment value is assigned to */pxn. 2 */mone + */pxn = #2:-0.5 The symbol */mone represents a negative modifier (e.g. ). The function of this rule: When there is a */mone in front of */pxn, a -0.5 sentiment value is assigned to */pxn. (3) As to type five and six, corresponding senti- ment value assignment rules are formulated in the phrase rule base PhraseRule.txt. The senti- ment value assignment rule samples: 3 ||||| /% + #[*/!(w|mone)] + /a = #3:0.5 The symbol #[*/!(w|mone)] means that the rule can cross arbitrary segmentations here ex- cept the punctuation(w) or negative modifi- er(mone) . Example (5) &lt;weibo&gt;: &lt;/weibo&gt; (It satisfies the match- ing condition of rule 3 , so a 0.5 sentiment value is assigned to the third item /a.) 4 |||/v + |||/p + #[*/!w] + |/% = #1:-0.5 Example (6) &lt;weibo&gt;: S6 iPhone6 &lt;/weibo&gt; (It satis- fies the matching condition of rule 4 , so a -0.5 sentiment value is assigned to the first item /v. Based on the sentiment lexicon SentiDic and sentiment value assignment rules in PhraseRule, the system CUCsas realizes the automatic recog- nition of whether there is an exp in the weibo discourse. Figure 2 shows the recognition proce- dure: Figure 2. The Procedure of the Exp Recognition </chunk></section><section><chunk>3 The Identification of Whether There Is a Semantic Orientation Relation- ship between Exp-Topic  The existence of an exp in the weibo message does not imply a semantic orientation relation- ship between the exp and the topic. Because the evaluation object of the exp has two potential choices: topic or non-topic. The system CUCsas uses the method of combining syntactic structure and semantic features to build a topic extraction and polarity classification rule base. The essence of the rule base is using formal languages to de- scribe the definite semantic direction relation- ships between exp-topic, which are induced by analyzing the training corpus by us. The topic extraction and polarity classification rule base consists of 10 rule modules with a total of 36 rules (see Table 1). Module 1 the exclusive method Explanation When the evaluation object of the exp is non-topic, the system will assign a 0 sentiment value to the topic, so as to avoid the weibo message continuing to match the latter rule modules and cause errors. Rule sample QSB + #[*/!w|topic] + */(NP)&amp;!(topic|vl) + #[*/!w|topic] + /% + #[*/!w] + */topic + #[*/!w] + */vl&amp;(n|in|ln) + #[*/!w] + */w|y|e|$ = N7:0 Rule sample explanation (1) QSB: It is a macro definition symbol (including the punctuation, conjunction, evaluation-triggering word, time word or discourse maker) used as the initial 151 item in this rule; (2) NP: It is a macro definition symbol (including the common noun or proper noun such as the name of a person, organization or product) representing a nominal element; (3) */topic: the given weibo topic; (4) */vl: an exp. Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;: &lt;/weibo&gt; [output: 0] Rule number 1-7 Module 2 the adversative compound sentence Explanation The content behind the adversative word is usually the semantic focus which the speaker wants to convey. Hence the rule only selects the exp appearing after the adversative word and semantically oriented to the topic as the output result, ig- noring the other exps in the weibo message. Rule sample QSB + #[*/%] + */topic + #[!(;|;||.)/!NP] + ZZC/% + #[,|,/%] + #[!(,|,|; |;||.|?|!|)/!NP|xjc] + */vl&amp;!hzv + #[!(?|?|||)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N8 Rule sample explanation (1) ZZC: It is a macro definition symbol (including a total of 23 adversative words, such as ); (2) =N3:N8: It means assigning the sentiment value of the eighth item */vl&amp;!hzv to the third item */topic. Matching example Topic: S6 &lt;weibo&gt;:,S6 &lt;/weibo&gt; [output:S6 1] Rule number 8-10 Module 3 topic-exp co-occurrence in the same clause Explanation When the topic and the exp appear in the same clause, the rule will select the exp nearest to the topic as the one semantically oriented it.(The exception is that the topic is the subject of a sentence expressing a causing or obtaining meaning or with a preposition + object adverbial.) In addition, according to the Chinese pragmatic habit that the semantic focus is usually located at the end of the dis- course, when exps appear both before and after the topic, i.e. exp1-topic-exp2, the rule will select exp2 only as the output result. Rule sample QSB + #[!(|)/!xjc] + */topic + #[*/!w|xjc|vl|nq] + */vl&amp;(!hzv) + #[!(?|?|| |)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N5 Rule sample explanation */vl&amp;(!hzv): The exp is arbitrary except for the backward-orientated sentiment verb(hzv) such as or , because the evaluation object of the hzv is usually the component after it, not the topic before it. Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;:&lt;/weibo&gt; [output: -1] Rule number 11-17 Module 4 the sentence expressing a causing or obtaining meaning Explanation When the topic is the subject of a sentence expressing a causing or obtaining meaning, the rule will select the last exp in the clause introduced by a word ex- pressing a causing or obtaining meaning as the output result. Rule sample QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!/!NP|xjc] + TSC/% + #[*/!w|topic|xjc] + */vl + #[!(?|?|||)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N7 Rule sample explanation TSC: It is a macro definition symbol (including a total of 31 words expressing a causing or obtaining meaning, such as or ). Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;: ,,&lt;/weibo&gt; [output: -1] Rule number 18 Module 5 the sentence with a preposition + object adverbial Explanation When the topic is the subject of a sentence with a preposition + object adver- bial, the rule will select the exp in the central components modified by the ad- verbial as the output result. 152 Rule sample QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!/!NP|xjc] + ||||/p + #[!(;|;| |.|?|!|:)/!topic|xjc] + */vl&amp;!(hzv|xlv) + #[!(?|?|||)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N7 Rule sample explanation */vl&amp;!(hzv|xlv): The exp is arbitrary except for the backward-orientated senti- ment verb(hzv) or psychological sentiment verb(xlv), because the evaluation object of the hzv or xlv is usually the object of the preposition, not the topic as the subject of the sentence. Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;:, &lt;/weibo&gt; [output: 1] Rule number 19 Module 6 the comparative sentence Explanation When the topic serves as the comparative subject in the comparative sentence, its sentiment vale = the sentiment value of the exp serving as the comparative re- sult; when the topic serves as the comparative datum in the comparative sen- tence, its sentiment vale = the sentiment value of the exp serving as the compara- tive result (-1) (Zhou Hongzhao et al., 2014). Rule sample QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!(|:|?|?)/!vl|xjc] + |||/p + #[!(|!|?|?|;)/!topic|xjc] + */vl + #[!(?|?|||)/!xjc|vl] + JSB = N3:N7 Rule sample explanation The */topic (N3) is located before the comparative-marker word ||| /p(N5) .So it serves as the comparative subject and its sentiment vale = the sentiment value of the exp */vl(N7) serving as the comparative result. Matching example Topic: S6 &lt;weibo&gt;: S6 , iPhone6 &lt;/weibo&gt; [output:S6 -1] Rule number 20-24 Module 7 the causation compound sentence Explanation In the causation compound sentence, the exp may appear in the reason clause, while its evaluation object appears in the result clause. Rule sample */topic + #[!(|?|!|;|;|:)/!xjc] + /% + #[*/!w] + */vl = N1:N5 Rule sample explanation In module 4, the topic is the reason, while the exp is the result. Here, the topic is the result, while the exp is the reason. The two rule modules complement each other. Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;: ,!&lt;/weibo&gt; [output: 1] Rule number 25 Module 8 The topic and the exp are distributed in different clauses or sentences. Type one: topic + exp Explanation The topic appears first, and then the exp appears in the clause or sentence adja- cent or nonadjacent to the clause or sentence the topic in. In this case, only the weibo message satisfies certain syntactic and semantic constraints, will the rule judge that the evaluation object of the exp is the topic. Rule sample QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!/!vl|xjc] + */w + #[!/!xjc|NP] + */vl + #1:3[!(||)/u|y|e] + JSB = N3:N7 Rule sample explanation Constraints of the rule sample: (1) There is no exp appearing together with the topic in the clause; (2) There is no NP appearing before the exp in the clause; (3) The word class after the exp is only auxiliary, modal or interjection, and three interrogative words and are forbidden. Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;: , &lt;/weibo&gt; [output: -1] Rule number 26-32 Module 9 The topic and the exp are distributed in different clauses or sentences. Type two: exp + topic 153 Explanation The exp appears first, and then the topic appears in the clause or sentence adja- cent or nonadjacent to the clause or sentence the exp in. In this situation, only the weibo message satisfies certain syntactic and semantic constraints, will the rule judge that the evaluation object of the exp is the topic. Rule sample */^ + #[*/!nq] + */na + #[*/!w] + */vl + #[*/!nq] + */topic&amp;nq = N7:N5 Rule sample explanation Constraints of the rule sample: (1) */^: The initial item of the rule is the weibo start marker; (2) #[*/!nq]: The word with a semantic marker of product name is forbidden; (3) */na: A word with the semantic marker of product attribute must appear; (4) */topic&amp;nq: The topic word must is also a product name. Matching example Topic: S6 &lt;weibo&gt;:// Galaxy S6 http://t.cn/RwQ6plU ( @ ) &lt;/weibo&gt; [output:S6 -1] Rule number 33-35 Module 10 anaphora resolution Explanation When the referent of a pronoun is the topic, the rule will assign the sentiment value of the exp semantically orientated to the pronoun to the topic. Rule sample */topic + #[*/!xjc|vl|NP] + ||||||/r + #[*/m|q] + #[*/!w|xjc|vl] + */vl + #[!(?|?|||)/!nr|xjc] + */$ = N1:N6 Rule sample explanation (1) #[*/m|q]: a numeral or quantifier can appear or not appear here; (2) */$: the end marker of the weibo message. Matching example Topic: &lt;weibo&gt;: &lt;/weibo&gt; [output: 1] Rule number 36 Note: (1) The 36 rules of the 10 rule modules are sequentially arranged, forming the topic extraction and sentiment polarity classification rule base. (2) Matching procedure: The weibo message matches the rule base starting from the first rule. If the matching succeeds, the system will output a corresponding matching result; if fails, the weibo message will skip to the second rule to continue matching. If this matching succeeds, the system will output a corresponding matching result; or else the weibo message will skip to the next rule to continue matching......If the matching still fails at the end of the rule base (i.e. rule 36), then the system will make a judgment that there is no semantic orientation relationship be- tween the exp and the topic in this weibo message and output a corresponding result: topic 0. The next weibo message matches the rule base in the same way......until the last weibo message in the experimental data. Table 1. Topic Extraction and Sentiment Polarity Classification Rule Base Based on the topic extraction and polarity classification rule base, the system CUCsas rea- lizes the automatic identification of whether there is a semantic orientation relationship be- tween the exp and the topic in the weibo message. If the weibo message matches the rule base un- successfully, the system will output topic 0; if successfully, the system will assign the value of the corresponding exp to the topic. If the value &gt; 0, the system will output: topic 1; if the value &lt; 0, the system will output: topic -1; if the value = 0, the system will output: topic 0. Figure 3 shows the general procedure: Figure 3. The Procedure of Topic Extraction and Sentiment Polarity Classification </chunk></section><section><heading>4 The Sentiment Polarity Classification of the Exp </heading><chunk>The term corresponding result in Figure 3 con- tains double meanings: i The corresponding 154 means that there is a semantic orientation rela- tionship between the exp and the topic. ii The result refers to the sentiment value and polarity of the exp in the weibo message context, not necessarily equals the value and polarity in the sentiment lexicon. i is guaranteed by 36 rules of 10 modules. ii is obtained by sentiment com- puting rules (see Table 2) in the PhraseRule.txt. Type 1 Contrary Description The sentiment polarity of the exp in the weibo message context is contrary to its sen- timent polarity in the senti- ment lexicon. Features (1) The exp is modified by the word with a negative se- mantic marker mone; (2) The exp appears in a negative sentence pattern characte- rized by words such as or ; (3) The exp appears in the special collo- cation characterized by spe- cific words. For instance, the sentiment polarity of is positive in the sentiment lex- icon, but when it collocates with or , its sentiment polarity will turn negative.

Features (1) The exp appears in the sentence introduced by the word with an evaluation dis- solving marker xjc such as 30 in all; (2) The exp appears in an evaluation dissolving sen- tence pattern characterized by the collocation of specific words or word classes, such as ......, exp + vv.

But the sentiment intensity can be unchanged, enhanced or weakened. Features (1) Features mentioned in type 1 and type 2 must not appear; (2) Features main- taining, enhancing or wea- kening the sentiment intensi- ty of the exp, such as seman- tic markers or specific words can appear.

Three Types of the Exp and Corresponding Sentiment Computing Rules Based on the sentiment computing rules stored in the PhraseRule, the system realizes the calcu- lation of the sentiment value of the exp in the weibo message context. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Experimental Results and Analysis </heading><chunk>Taking 20 given topics and a total of 19,469 weibo messages released by SIGHAN-2015 Bake-off as the test data, the experimental results of the sentiment analysis system CUCsas are as follows: SIGHAN- 2015 Bake-off (unrestricted test) Precision 0.6937182 Recall 0.6937182 F 0.6937182 Precision+ 0.1839539 Recall+ 0.36024305 F+ 0.24354461 Precision- 0.5010653 Recall- 0.3877439 F- 0.4371805 Table 3. The SIGHAN-2015 Bake-off (Unre- stricted Test) Evaluation Result of CUCsas Only using the sentiment lexicon resource, the experimental results are as follows: SIGHAN- Precision 0.46001335 155 2015 Bake-off (unrestricted test) Recall 0.46001335 F 0.46001335 Precision+ 0.12713068 Recall+ 0.62152778 F+ 0.2110849 Precision- 0.34455307 Recall- 0.6779335 F- 0.45689415 Table 4. Only Using the Sentiment Lexicon Using the sentiment lexicon together with the phrase rule base resource, the experimental re- sults are as follows: SIGHAN- 2015 Bake-off (unrestricted test) Precision 0.48019929 Recall 0.48019929 F 0.48019929 Precision+ 0.13504006 Recall+ 0.59982639 F+ 0.22044983 Precision- 0.34286523 Recall- 0.66556746 F- 0.45258339 Table 5. Using the Sentiment Lexicon Together with the Phrase Rule Base Comparing Table 4 with Table 5, we can see the introduction of the phrase rule base improved the system overall performance, but only to a small extent. Comparing Table 5 with Table 3, we can see the introduction of the topic extrac- tion and polarity classification rule base further improved the system overall performance to a large extent. At present, the overall F value of the system is about 0.69. Evaluation results in Table 3 suggest that the performance of the system is good in dealing with neutral sentiment weibo messages, but poor in dealing with positive sentiment wei- bo messages (F+0.24) and negative sentiment weibo messages (F-0.44). Reasons and solving methods for poor Recall+ and Recall- : (1) The scale of the topic extraction and polarity classification rule base built accord- ing to the training data is small (only 36 rules). Thus, the language phenomena having not ap- peared in the training data cant be covered. For instance, the module 10 anaphora resolution neglects the case that the pronoun appears ahead of the topic. In the next stage, new rules will be added to the rule base to expand its coverage. (2) The sentiment lexicon and the sentiment phrase rule base are not incomplete so that many exps in the test data cant be recognized. In the next stage, the system will improve the automatic rec- ognition of unlisted exps. Reasons and solving methods for poor Preci- sion+ and Precision-: (1) Some rules in the topic extraction and polarity classification rule base do not appropriately describe the semantically orientated relationship between topic-exp, which leads to the wrong extraction of exps. In the next stage, some rules will be revised based on the errors analysis. (2) Some exps in the sentiment lexicon actually do not have evaluation meaning. For example, the word is not a sentiment word. However, it is listed in the sentiment lex- icon as a negative word. Therefore, the sentiment polarity output result of Topic : in &lt;wei- bo&gt;: &lt;/weibo&gt; is wrong -1. In the next stage, the sentiment lexicon will be checked and non-sentiment words will be removed. </chunk></section><section><heading>6 Conclusion </heading><chunk>In this paper, firstly, we proposed the algorithm of rule-based weibo messages sentiment polarity classification towards given topics. Then, we adopted the rule methods to implement the re- quirements of the algorithm procedures. Based on the sentiment lexicon SentiDic and sentiment value assignment rules in PhraseRule, the senti- ment analysis system CUCsas realized the auto- matic recognition of the exp in weibo messages. Based on the topic extraction and polarity classi- fication rule base, the system realized the auto- matic identification of whether there is a seman- tic orientation relationship between the exp and the topic. And based on the sentiment computing rules in PhraseRule, the system realized the sen- timent value calculation and polarity classifica- tion of the exp in specific weibo message context. At present, the overall F value of the ruled-based sentiment analysis system CUCsas is about 0.69. In the future, the lexicon and rule base will be revised based on the errors analysis to improve the performance of the system. </chunk></section><section><heading>Reference </heading><chunk>Amit Gupte, Sourabh Joshi, Pratik Gadgul, Ak- shay Kadam. 2014.
