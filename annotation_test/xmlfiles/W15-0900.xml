The workshop has been held almost every year since 2003 in conjunction with ACL, EACL, NAACL, COLING and LREC. By now, it provides the main venue of the field for interaction, sharing of resources and tools and collaboration efforts for advancing the computational treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs), attracting the attention of an ever-growing community from all around the world working on a variety of languages and MWE types. MWEs include idioms (storm in a teacup, sweep under the rug), fixed phrases (in vitro, by and large), noun compounds (olive oil, laser printer), compound verbs (take a nap, bring about), among others. These, while easily mastered by native speakers, are a key issue and a current weakness for natural language parsing and generation, as well as real-life applications depending on some degree of semantic interpretation, such as machine translation, just to name a prominent one among many. However, thanks to the joint efforts of researchers from several fields working on MWEs, significant progress has been made in recent years, especially concerning the construction of large-scale language resources. For instance, there is a large number of recent papers that focus on acquisition of MWEs from corpora, and others that describe a variety of techniques to find paraphrases for MWEs. Current methods use a plethora of tools such as association measures, machine learning, syntactic patterns, web queries, etc. In the call for papers we solicited submissions about major challenges in the overall process of MWE treatment, both from the theoretical and the computational viewpoint, focusing on original research related (but not limited) to the following topics: Lexicon-grammar interface for MWEs Parsing techniques for MWEs Hybrid parsing of MWEs Annotating MWEs in treebanks MWEs in Machine Translation and Translation Technology Manually and automatically constructed resources Representation of MWEs in dictionaries and ontologies MWEs and user interaction Multilingual acquisition iii Multilingualism and MWE processing Models of first and second language acquisition of MWEs Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs The role of MWEs in the domain adaptation of parsers Integration of MWEs into NLP applications Evaluation of MWE treatment techniques Lexical, syntactic or semantic aspects of MWEs Submission modalities included long papers and short papers. From a total of 27 submissions, of which 14 were long papers and 13 were short papers, we accepted 5 long papers for oral presentation and 3 as posters. We further accepted 3 short papers for oral presentation and 3 as posters. The overall acceptance rate is 52%. The workshop also featured an invited talk by Paul Kay (International Computer Science Institute, UC Berkeley) and Laura A. Michaelis (Department of Linguistics and Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado Boulder) on "How Constructions Mean". Acknowledgements We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for the timely reviews and the authors for their valuable contributions.
