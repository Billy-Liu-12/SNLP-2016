We shall argue with Tuller (1986) that Hausa resumption (both overt and covert) opens up the possibility for relativisation only to escape well-attested extraction islands in the language. As suggested by the mutual compatibility of gaps and resumptives in ATB extraction, however, we shall conclude that both strategies must be regarded as un- bounded dependencies (UDCs) to be mod- elled via the feature in HPSG. We shall discuss how the treatment of UDCs has been generalised, in HaG, to permit more than one simultaneous depen- dency, and focus in particular on how the distinction between true gaps and resump- tive elements can be exploited to ad- dress efficiency issues. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Resumptives and gaps in Hausa extraction </heading><chunk>Like many other languages, Hausa makes use of extraction in a variety of constructions, including relative clause formation, matrix and embedded wh-questions, and focus fronting. Alongside gap strategies, familiar from English, Hausa also em- ploys resumption, marking the extraction site with a pronominal. (1) wa who ka 2....... auri marry ya daughter. *(-r -of.-3.... -sa) ? Whose daughter did you marry? (Jaggar, 2001) (2) sanda stick suka 33.... doke beat shi 33... da with *(ita) 33.. It was a stick they beat him with. (Jaggar, 2001) The distribution of gaps and resumptives partly overlap: while in some contexts only a resump- tive strategy is possible, e.g. with possessors of nouns (1), or with complements of non-locative prepositions (2), extraction of core arguments (di- rect/indirect objects) in general permits both strate- gies, with a clear preference for zero expression in the case of direct objects (Newman, 2000; Jaggar, 2001) for short extraction. (3) muta nen men da suka 3...... i refuse sayar sell musu to.them / / wa to da with abinci food suka 3...... fita left the men they refused to sell food to left. (Jaggar, 2001, p. 534) As stated by Crysmann (2012), the preference for direct object gaps, however, is much reduced in slightly more complex cases, involving, e.g. Across- The-Board (ATB) extraction or long-distance rel- ativisation (see the discussion below), making re- sumption a natural, if not the only option. As shown in (4), an overt resumptive is retained in the second conjunct. (4) [aboki-n-a] i friend- -1...... da [[na 1...... ziyarta i ] visit amma but [ban 1.......... sa me find shi i 3....... a at gida home ba]] my friend that I visited but did not find at home (New- man, 2000, p. 539) Example (4) further illustrates that extraction from coordinate structures in Hausa appears to treat resumptives on a par with gaps, as far as the ATB constraint is concerned. Another important obser- vation relates to the possibility of ATB extraction to target different grammatical functions in both con- junct, as illustrated in (5). (5) mutumin i man da na 1...... ba give shi i 3....... aro-n lending- bargo-na blanket-.1.... amma but duk da in spite of haka that i yake 3......... jin feel- sanyi cold the man whom I lent my blanket but who still felt cold (Newman, 2000, p. 540) 65 A central property of Hausa resumption is that it permits long distance relativisation out of extrac- tion islands: these include relative clauses, embed- ded wh-clauses, subject clauses, and complement clauses of non-bridge verbs (see Tuller (1986) for the full set of data). We illustrate here on the ba- sis of embedded relative clauses: as shown below, relativisation of an indirect (6) or human direct ob- ject (7) out of relatives is fine, provided there is a resumptive in situ. (6) Ga here.is tabobin j cigarettes da Ali Ali ya 3........ san know mutumin i man da i zai 3........ yi do musu j to.them / / *wa j to kwali box Here are the cigarettes that Ali knows the man that will make a box for. (Tuller, 1986, p. 84; tone added) (7) Ga here.is mutumin j man da ka 2........ ga see yarinyar i girl da i ta 3........ san know shi j him / / *sani know j Heres the man that you saw the girl that knows him. (Tuller, 1986, p. 85; tone added) The grammar of extraction in Hausa heavily in- teracts with argument drop: as discussed by Tuller (1986), Hausa allows pro drop not only with sub- jects, but also with non-human direct objects, which receive a specific, i.e. non-generic interpretation (Jaggar, 2001). Subject properties are identified by agreement marking on the discrete TAM markers. (8) a. Ka 2........ ga see littafi-n book-of Musa? Musa Did you see Musas book? b. I, Yes na 1...... gan see shi. 3.... / I, Yes na 1...... gani see Yes, I saw it. (Tuller, 1986, p. 61; tone added) (9) a. Ka 2........ ga see ane-n brother-of Musa? Musa Did you see Musas brother? b. I, Yes na 1...... gan see shi. 3.... / *I, Yes na 1...... gani see Yes, I saw him. (Tuller, 1986, p. 62; tone added) As discovered by Tuller (1986), the possibility for relativisation to escape what are otherwise ex- traction islands in the language extends from overt resumptives to zero pronominals. I.e., she observes that non-human direct objects, which can be freely pro-dropped, do permit long relativisation out of is- lands even without an overt resumptive, whereas di- rect objects with human reference do so only if re- alised overtly by a direct object pronominal affix. (10) mutumin i man da ka 2........ san know littafin j book [da i ya 3........ rubu ta write j ] the man that you know the book (he) wrote (Tuller, 1986, p. 81) (11) littafin i book da ka 2........ san know mutumin j man [da j ya 3........ rubu ta write i ] the book that you know the man who wrote (it) (Tuller, 1986, p. 81) The very same can be shown to hold for wh is- lands: again, relativisation out of wh clauses is pos- sible for subjects, and for non-human direct objects, even without an overt resumptive. (12) mutumin i man da ka 2........ san know [me j what i ya 3........ rubu ta write j ] the man that you know what (he) wrote (Tuller, 1986, p. 80) (13) littafin i book da ka 2........ san know [wa j who j ya 3........ rubu ta write i ] the book that you know who wrote (it) (Tuller, 1986, p. 80) The converse, however, is not true: wh phrases never extract out of either relative or embedded wh clauses, regardless of the presence of overt or covert resumptives. Examples (14) and (15) illustrates this for subjects and non-human direct objects, whereas (17) provides evidence that resumption (here with an oblique) does not improve acceptability. (14) * wane which mutum i man ka 2........ ba give ni me littafin j book da i ya 3........ rubu ta write j Which man did you give me the book that wrote (Tuller, 1986, p. 81; tone added) (15) * wane which littafi j book ka 2........ san know wa i who i ya 3........ rubu ta write j which book do you know who wrote (Tuller, 1986, p. 80; tone added) (16) wa j who ka 2........ yi do magana talking da with shi j 3.... Who did you talk with? (Tuller, 1986, p. 158) (17) * wa j who ka 2........ san know ma tar i woman [da i ta 3........ yi do magana talking da with shi j ] 3.... Who do you know the woman that talked to him (Tuller, 1986, p. 159) The most complex case of long-distance relativi- sation cited in the literature involves triply embed- ded relatives, with all three extraction sites con- tained within the inner-most sub-clause. 66 (18) ? ga here.is ma tar i woman da ka 22...... ba give ni me littafin j book da ma lamai teachers suka 33.... san know mutumin k man da i ta 33...... rubu ta write wa for k j Heres the woman that you gave me the book the teachers know the man she wrote it for. (Tuller, 1986, p. 84; tone added) To summarise the empirical data, relativisation in Hausa is insensitive to extraction islands, provided the presence of a resumptive pronoun at the extrac- tion site. Other types of extraction, like wh or fo- cus fronting, do not exhibit this property, regard- less of the presence of resumptives. As suggested by extraction from coordinate structures, however, resumptives are fully compatible with gaps, as far as the ATB constraint is concerned. We therefore conclude that both processes should be considered unbounded dependency constructions (UDCs), yet the specific constraints on locality and on the use of gaps vs. resumptives should be associated with prop- erties of the elements at the top or the bottom of the dependency: i.e. the difference between a single rel- ative marker merely mediating coreference with the antecedent noun vs. a full displaced constituent, as well as the nature of the governing head at the ex- traction site, i.e. verbs vs. prepositions. </chunk></section><section><heading>1.1 Previous approaches </heading><chunk>The first extensive formal study of Hausa extraction and resumption certainly is Tullers (1986) doctoral dissertation on the language. Using a GB frame- work she suggests to account for the difference between island-insensitive resumptive relativisation and wh extraction by means of a distinction between base-generation and binding of a pronominal for rel- ativisation vs. A movement for wh-extraction. Re- sumptives found in wh extraction as complements of obliques or possessors of nouns, by contrast, are treated as instances of phonetic trace (Koopman, 1984). The multitude of analytic devices (both base generation and movement with phonetic trace) for what appears to be a single phenomenon (resump- tion) has been criticised in Crysmann (2012). Within HPSG, one of the first studies are the works of Nathan Vaillette on resumption in He- brew (2001a) and Irish (2001b), proposing two separate features for gap and resumptive extrac- tions. This separation has been criticised re- peatedly in the HPSG literature, including Tagh- vaipour (2004; Taghvaipour (2005b; Taghvaipour (2005a), (Alotaibi and Borsley, 2013), and (Crys- mann, 2012), mainly based on the known compati- bility of gaps and resumptives in ATB extraction. More specifically, Crysmann (2012) argues, on the basis of the Hausa data, for the compatibility between the two types of extractions. He shows fur- ther that no HPSG treatment available at the time was capable to capture the differences with respect to extraction islands. He suggests that both types of unbounded dependencies should be regarded as dependencies, distinguishing gap and resump- tive dependencies in terms of the properties of the elements. More precisely, he argues that gaps require sharing of entire values, whereas shar- ing of values is sufficient for resumptives (see Borsley (2010; Alotaibi and Borsley (2013) for a similar proposal). Since the description of resump- tives subsumes that of gaps, the ATB facts are read- ily explained. The differences in locality, however, are due to constraints imposed at the retrieval site: while wh and focus fronting require full sharing of their values, relatives merely require index sharing. If retrieval sites are transparent to indices, but not to full local values, the empirical pattern can be explained with a single mechanism. A previous implementation of resumption in HaG has treated these elements essentially like gaps, including the restriction of to contain at most one element at any time. In this paper, we shall ex- plore how the empirically and theoretically more de- sirable approach advanced in Crysmann (2012) can be put to use in a computational grammar of the language. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Implementation in LKB &amp; friends </heading><chunk>The implementation in HaG follows quite closely the theoretical proposal made in Crysmann (2012). Thus, both gap and resumptive dependencies are represented on , HPSGs feature for extrac- tion, distinguishing them for the purposes of island effects in terms of the elements rather than by virtue of a distinct unbounded dependency. </chunk></section><section><heading>2.1 The Grammar Matrix </heading><chunk>The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002) is a starter kit for the development of HPSG gram- mars running on the LKB (Copestake, 2002), Pet (Callmeier, 2000) and Ace (by Woodley Packard (Crysmann and Packard, 2012)) platforms. Gram- mars running on these platforms use a conjunctive subset of TDL (Krieger, 1996) as their descrip- tion language and Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005) for meaning representation. The Grammar Matrix not only makes for fast boot- strapping of new grammars, it also ensures a high de- gree of parallelism, owing to a carefully worked out constraint set on meaning construction combined 67 with a type hierarchy of rule types, suitable for a wider range of syntactic constructions. The Matrix has been distilled to a great extent from the LinGO ERG (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000). As for extraction, both the ERG and the Matrix are highly faithful to the theory of un- bounded dependencies advanced by Sag (1997) and Ginzburg and Sag (2001): thus, passing of non-local features (most notably ) proceeds in a head- driven fashion, with heads amalgamating the - values of their arguments. (19) amalgamation [ [ 1 ... n ] ] --- [ [ 1 ] ] , ... [ [ n ] ] In the ERG and the Matrix, amalgamation is bro- ken down into four constraints depending on the ar- ity of the argument structure list, one of which any lexical head will inherit from. Owing to the absence of sets (and set union) in the underlying formalism, set-valued features are represented by means of dif- ference lists (Clocksin and Mellish, 1981) instead, 1 instead, as shown in the example for two-element argument structure lists in (20). (20) 0-diff-list 1 1 1-diff-list [ ] 1 1 basic-two-arg 1 3 --- 1 2 , 2 3 Among the lexical amalgamation types, there is already one definition in the Matrix specifically aimed at resumptive pronouns, i.e. the possibility to launch a non-local dependency that does not corre- spond to an argument. However, this constraint will only ever be suitable for free pronouns, not bound ones, as we find in Hausa, since the type constraint is defined on the level of the lexical entry. Further- more, resumption is still treated as entirely identical to gap-type extraction. Besides these more technical issues, there is, how- ever, a more fundamental difference between the 1 Difference lists permit list concatenation by means of uni- fication: essentially, such lists maintain a pointer () to the open end of the list. We shall use exclamation marks to distin- guish these from ordinary lists, as is the convention in DELPH- IN grammars (Copestake, 2002, cf.). treatment of dependencies in the theoreti- cal HPSG literature and its implementation in the ERG and the Matrix: while Pollard and Sag (1994) clearly argue that more than one element can be in at the same time, the ERG and the Matrix both limit the length of the list to at most one, thereby ruling out the combination of strong and weak UDCs witnessed in (21). The reason be- hind this restriction is most certainly related to pro- cessing efficiency. (21) [A violin this well crafted] 1 even [the most difficult sonata] 2 will be easy to play _ 2 on _e 1 ? (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 169) While for English, cases of multiple simultaneous dependencies can possibly be marginalised without jeopardising overall coverage on natural lan- guage data, this is certainly not the case in a variety of other languages, including multiple wh-fronting in Slavic, or long-distance relativisation in Hausa. Thus, a more systematic solution is called for that we shall develop in the following section. </chunk></section><section><heading>2.2 Multiple SLASH dependencies </heading><chunk>Since HaG is based on the Grammar Matrix, the current general approach to extraction is already head-driven, in accordance with the current consen- sus amongst HPSG scholars. Since restrictions on the size of are imposed on introduction and retrieval, we can concentrate on these two critical points in our discussion of extraction in HaG. 2.2.1 Launching With the exception of adjunct extraction, 2 gaps in HaG are introduced by means of unary lexical rules suppressing a valency corresponding to an argument introduced into , essentially following Pollard and Sag (1994), Sag (1997), Ginzburg and Sag (2001), as well as common practice in the ERG and the Matrix. In addition, a unary phrase structure rule permits launching of adjunct extractions. As for resumptives, the current implementation maintains two sets of lexical rules, one for bound pronominals and one for bound resumptives, as well as two sets of lexical entries for pronominals and re- sumptives. Making systematic use of the type hier- archy of rules and lexical types, shared properties of resumptive and non-resumptive uses, including autosegmental morphophonological properties, are abstracted out into common supertypes. Most cru- cially, in the true pronominal case, a semantic rela- tion is inserted into the MRS list and the 2 See Levine (2003) for arguments to distinguish adjunct and complement extraction in English along the syntax/lexicon divide. 68 value is restricted to be empty, whereas in the re- sumptive case, the list is empty, but con- tains an element the referential index of which is shared with that of the resumptive. Owing to the absence of internal disjunction from the underlying feature formalism (rules and lexical entries are in disjunctive normal form), specification of separate rules and entries for both uses turned out to be un- avoidable. 3 In order to keep the number of disjunc- tive specifications to an absolute minimum, we have therefore generalised the existing 3 sets of morpho- logical rules for pronominal affixation (objective, genitive, dative), capturing the difference in shape by reference to the segmental make-up of the base, rather than in terms of the syntactic category of the base, enabling us to collapse all three sets into one. This move was greatly facilitated by the fact that nouns and verbs, as well as the applicative marker wa independently undergo characteristic inflection for the type of argument realisation of their first complement (Crysmann, 2005), distinguishing inter alia realisation by a pronominal affix: e.g., pronomi- nal affixes from the genitive set are always preceded by the gender differentiated linker -n/-r (cf. exam- ple (1)), a segment that is crucially absent in final positions of all verbs taking pronominal affixes from the direct object set. To account for differences in tonal specification (genitive set is low, whereas ob- jective set alternates), we generalised our previous treatment of polar tone with objective pronouns, representing the tonal specification of the pronomi- nal affix as a floating tone of the base. In fact, Following Crysmann (2012), the main difference between gap and resumptive values is that the former require reentrancy with a full local value, whereas the latter are underspecified in this respect: minimally, they only require identity of . Elab- orating on the hierarchy of synsem proposed in Sag (1997), we have complemented the gap subtype of synsem with a type for resumptives and abstracted out shared minimal requirements into a common su- per type. (22) gap-or-res [ ........... 1 ] [ ! [ ........... 1 ] ! ] gap 1 full-local [ ! 1 ! ] resump [ ! light-local ! ] 3 Underspecification techniques using list types do not pro- vide a solution either, since we need to use difference lists for which this abstraction is only available to a limited extent. (23) [ local mrs ] [ full-local cat ] light-local Using the types just introduced, extraction and resumption rules are the defined as follows: (24) Complement extraction [ [ [ l ] ] ] [ [ gap | l ] ] (25) Resumption [ [ [ l ] ] ] [ [ gap-or-res | l ] ] Both rules perform a valence reduction, but do so imposing constraints of different strength on the locally suppressed complement. Since elements of the valence list are reentrant with ---, the restriction towards will be picked up correctly by amalgamation. For resumption, the gram- mar distinguishes variants for null realisation (sub- ject and non-human direct object) and pronominal affixation. On the basis of the distinction between full-local and light-local values, we have furthermore defined typed list constraints that permit to restrict what kind of dependencies can be active simultaneously. As we have seen above, only relativisation can es- cape wh-islands in Hausa, provided the dependency involves a resumptive. Furthermore, relative clause formation, in contrast to wh-extraction and focus fronting, does not permit pied-piping. Thus, mul- tiple simultaneous dependencies can involve at most one single gap type dependency at any node. Most importantly, this state of affairs enables us to ensure termination in the light of adjunct extraction which involves true gaps: whenever a true gap is in- serted into , the remainder of the list is constrained to consist entirely of elements of type light-local. Complement extraction lexical rules are constrained in a similar fashion. </chunk></section><section><heading>2.2.2 Retrieval </heading><chunk>Given that values may contain multiple ele- ments, retrieval at the top of the dependency marks a more clear departure from common practice in the Grammar Matrix: in essence, we need to search the list for a suitable element to be bound off, and 69 pass on any light-local elements to be retrieved fur- ther up the tree. The grammar has exactly two constructions where retrieval can take place, the first one being a classical filler-head construction to be used for bind- ing wh and focus-fronted fillers, both of which al- low pied-piping. As for relatives, we follow Borsley and assume that Hausa relative pronouns are ac- tually (inflected) relative complementisers that take the clause containing a gap or resumptive as its com- plement. This assumption not only takes care of the impossibility of pied-piping in relative clauses, but it also captures nicely the similarity of the un- inflected relative complementiser da to its homony- mous non-relative counterpart. What is common to both constructions is that they define a non-empty ----- value (cf. Pollard and Sag (1994)). 4 In filler-head structures, the dependency to be retrieved is constrained to be of type full-local by virtue of structure sharing with the fillers value, whereas no such constraint is imposed by the relative complementiser which only requires a refer- ential index. (26) filler-head-rule ..... -- l s ! ! ---- [ [ l ] ] ---- [ [ [ s ] ] ] (27) rel-complementiser-lex -- [ [ [ i ] ] ] s ! i ref-index ! ! ! --- S [ [ s ] ] Two unary retrieval rules then take care of bind- ing the filler to an appropriate percolated ele- ment and to pass on any elements of type light-local. 4 All lexical entries other than the relative complementiser require their entire ----- value to be empty (i.e. both - ..... and -----......). Furthermore, we constrain the type head-nexus-phrase (Sag, 1997) as well as standard unary phrase structure rules to effect structure sharing of ----- be- tween the mother and the (head) daughter. Similarly, elements on --- are equally restricted to have empty ----- features. As a net effect, no other syntactic rule can interfere in the mid- dle of retrieval. (28) bind-filler-rule 0 -- ! l ! s q r 0 -- f ! f | l ! s q r (29) find-filler-rule 0 -- f l ! 1 light-local | s ! q r 0 -- f ! 1 | l ! s q r While the bind-filler-rule performs the actual in- stantiation and retrieval of the unbounded depen- dency, the find-filler-rule merely iterates over the original difference list and puts back one by one the original elements, constrained to light-local. In essence, these rules jointly ensure the island re- striction towards non-resumptive dependen- cies: since extraction out of relative and wh islands is restricted to relativisation footed by a resump- tive, the constraints on light-local for further per- colation after the first retrieval of a element accounts for the ungrammaticality of, e.g. (14) and (15), while still permitting relativisation out of rela- tives, as witnessed in (18). 5 5 One might wonder why we insist on full perusal of ((((), even after a filler has been found, instead of merely constrain- ing the remainder of the list using the aforementioned list types. First, this recursion does not add any complexity factor beyond the possibility of that introduced by considering alternative in- stantiations for the filler. Second, recreating the list re- cursively step by step from the unretrieved elements enables us to get rid of any latent constraints on the open end of the list regarding local type: once we have retrieved a full-local depen- dency, we want to be able to add new gap dependencies further 70 2.2.3 ATB extraction The underspecification approach to resumptives, i.e. their compatibility with both light-local and full- local, already ensures the compatibility between true gaps and resumption in ATB extraction from coordinated structures. Furthermore, given the am- biguity of pronominals between resumptive and true pronoun uses, identity requirements will only have to hold for those pronominals that actually enter in a non-local dependency. To this end, we restrict coordinating construc- tions to enforce identity of entire lists, as shown in (30). (30) s-binary-coord [ [ s ] ] ---- [ [ [ s ] ] ] ---- [ [ [ s ] ] ] A complicating factor, however, comes in ow- ing to the use of lists, instead of sets, imposed by the underlying formalism. As detailed in Newman (2000), ATB extraction may target different gram- matical functions in both conjuncts. Since Hausa also permits multiple relativisation from the same clause (Tuller, 1986), we expect multiple ATB rela- tivisation to be possible also with reversal of gram- matical functions, as illustrated by the (constructed) example in (31). (31) ga there.is mutum man. da kuka you..... san know ma tar woman... da yake 3......... son like..of -ta -3.... amma but take 3......... in hate..of -sa -3.... Heres the man that you know the woman who he likes but (who) hates him. In order to allow for this possibility, we com- plement the standard coordination schema sketched above with an alternative one that has the first ele- ments of the right conjunct reversed. For efficiency reasons, I am currently limiting myself to permutation of the first two ele- ments. This decision, however, is supported by the observation that triple relativisation in itself is already considered marked to some extent: see Tullers question mark on the relevant example in (18). While these data clearly contrast with the un- acceptability of island violations, I seriously doubt that their marked acceptability will improve when combined with ATB extraction from non-parallel up the tree, independently of whether this new element will be prepended or appended to our current list. conjuncts, thereby further increasing complexity. Thus, until we have evidence to the contrary, I shall refrain, for the time being, from full permutation of lists greater than 2, assuming parallelism of dependencies except for the first two elements. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Conclusion </heading><chunk>We have argued in this paper that Hausa extrac- tion militates for an extension of current practice in HPSG grammar implementation to permit mul- tiple simultaneous dependencies. Based on the theoretical proposal by Crysmann (2012), we have provided an implementation of the Hausa ex- traction facts. In essence, we have generalised the constraints on to permit multiple members at any time, but have systematically exploited the dis- tinction between light and full local values to con- strain multiple extraction to involve at most on gap simultaneously. This not only correctly captures the island constraints in Hausa, but it also provides a straightforward means to ensure efficiency, includ- ing termination of adjunct extraction. Furthermore, to keep disjunctive specifications of pronominal and resumptive uses to a minimum, we have developed a more generalised treatment of pronominal affixa- tion in the language, collapsing morphological rules for genitive accusative and dative pronominal af- fixes. In future work, we shall explore how the systematic ambiguity between resumptive and non- resumptive uses of pronominals may be captured without disjunctive specification at all, in order to provide a complete answer to McCloskeys (2002) generalisation. </chunk></section><section><heading>Acknowledgements </heading><chunk>Work on HaG is partially supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements dAvenir programme (reference: ANR-10-LABX-0083), project ResHau [re:zo:] of the Laboratoire dexcellence Empirical Founda- tions of Linguistics. </chunk></section><section><heading>References </heading><chunk>Mansour Alotaibi and Robert D.
