Costa-juss` a 1 Centro de Investigaci  on en Computaci  on, Instituto Polit  ecnico Nacional, Mexico 1 marta@nlp.cic.ipn.mx Abstract Chinese and Spanish have different mor- phology structures, which poses a big challenge for translating between this pair of languages. In this paper, we analyze several strategies to better generalize from the Chinese non-morphology-based lan- guage to the Spanish rich morphology- based language. Strategies use a first-step of Spanish morphology-based simplifica- tions and a second-step of fullform gen- eration. The latter can be done using a translation system or classification meth- ods. Finally, both steps are combined ei- ther by concatenation in cascade or inte- gration using a factored-based style. On- going experiments (based on the United Nations corpus) and their results are de- scribed. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>The structure of Chinese and Spanish differs at most linguistic levels, e.g. morphology, syntax and semantics. In this paper, we are focusing on reducing the gap between both languages at the level of morphology. On the one hand, Chi- nese is an isolating language, which means hav- ing a low morpheme per word ratio. On the other hand, Spanish is a fusional language, which means having a tendency to overlay many morphemes. The challenge when translating between Chinese and Spanish is bigger in the direction from Chi- nese to Spanish, given that the same Chinese word can generate multiple Spanish words. For exam- ple, the Chinese word f` an (in transcribed Pinyin) can be translated by comer, como, com  , comer  e 1 which correspond to several tense flexions of the same verb and also by comes, comiste, comer  as 2 , 1 to eat, I eat, I ate, I will eat 2 you eat, you ate, you will eat all of which also correspond to several person flex- ions of the same verb. This poses a challenge in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) because translations are learnt by co-ocurrence of words in both languages. When a word has multiple transla- tions, it generates sparsity in the translation model. In this study, we experiment with different strategies to add morphology knowledge in a stan- dard phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2003) for the Chinese-to-Spanish translation di- rection. However, the presented techniques could be used for other pairs involving isolating and fu- sional languages. The rest of the paper is or- ganized as follows. Section 2 reports a brief overview of the related work both in using mor- phology knowledge in SMT and in translating from Chinese-to-Spanish. Section 3 explains the theoretical framework of phrase-based SMT at a high level and the details of each strategy to intro- duce morphology in the mentioned system. Sec- tion 4 describes the experiments and first results obtained for each theoretical strategy presented. Finally, Section 5 concludes this ongoing research and outlines the future research directions. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Related Work </heading><chunk>There are numerous studies which deal with mor- phology in the field of SMT. Without aiming at completeness, we cite works that: Preprocess the data to make the structure of both languages more similar by means of en- riching (Avramidis and Koehn, 2008; Ueffing and Ney, 2003) or segmentation techniques in agglutinative (S.Virpioja et al., 2007) or fu- sional languages (Costa-juss` a, 2015a) Modify models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) Post-process the data (Toutanova et al., 2008; Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011; Formiga et al., 2013). 56 The research work in this area is being very ac- tive, e.g. PhD proposals using strategies based on deep learning (Gutierrez-Vasques, 2015). Previous works on the Chinese-Spanish lan- guage pair focus on compiling corpus and us- ing pivot stategies (Costa-juss` a et al., 2012) and on building a Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) system (Costa-juss` a and Centelles, In Press 2015). A high-level description of the state- of-the-art of the translation on this language pair is detailed in (Costa-juss` a, 2015b). Our work mixes several strategies but basically it goes in the direction of (Formiga et al., 2013) that focuses on solving the challenge of mor- phology as a post-processing classification prob- lem. The idea is to translate from Chinese to a morphology-based simplified Spanish and, then, re-generate the morphology by means of classi- fication algorithms. The competitive advantage from this strategy is the rise of algorithms based on deep learning techniques that can achieve high success rates, e.g. (Collobert et al., 2011). </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Theoretical Framework </heading><chunk>The phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2003) is trained on a parallel corpus at the level of sentences. It learns co-ocurrences and each token in the training set is considered as a different one no matter if it is morphologically related. There- fore, in the extreme case where the word canto 3 is in the training set and the inflection of the same verb cant  e 4 is not, the latter is going to be consid- ered an out-of-vocabulary word. Strategy 1. One well-known strategy to face this challenge is to add a part-of-speech (POS) lan- guage model which evaluates the probability of the POS-sequences instead of the word sequences. Strategy 2. This second strategy consists on do- ing a cascade of systems: first, translate from source to morphology-based simplified target; sec- ond, translate from this simplified target to full- form target as shown in Figure 3. One straightforward simplification in morphol- ogy can be adopting lemmas as shown in Table 1. Strategy 3. This third strategy is based on factored-based translation (Koehn and Hoang, 2007), which uses linguistic information of words, 3 I sing 4 I sang Figure 1: Illustration of the cascade strategy. e.g. lemmas and POS. The idea is that the trans- lation model based on words is used if the trans- lation of the word is available, and if not, lemmas and POS are used in combination with a model to generate the final word. Figure 3 shows a typical representation of this factored strategy. Figure 2: Illustration of the factored strategy. Strategy 4. This fourth strategy is based on pre- vious work like (Formiga et al., 2013), where the idea is to do a first translation from source to a morphology-based simplified target and then, use a classifier to go from this simplified target to the fullform target. See the schema of this classification-based strategy in 3. The main challenges in the last strategy are: 1. Explore different simplifications of the target language in order to use the one with a higher trade-off between the highest oracle and the lowest classification complexity. 2. Explore several classification algorithms. 57 Es lemmas decidir examinar el cuesti  on en el per  odo de sesi  on el tema titular cuesti  on relativo a el derecho humano Es N lemmas Decide examinar la cuesti  on en el per  odo de sesi  on el tema titulado cuesti  on relativas a los derecho humanos .

Table 1: Example of Spanish simplification into lemmas and different variations . Figure 3: Illustration of the classification-based strategy. In this paper, we study the first challenge of ex- ploring different simplifications. However, we do not face the classification challenge, which is left to further work. It would be interesting to use deep learning knowledge which is leading to large im- provements in natural language processing (Col- lobert et al., 2011). </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Ongoing Experiments </heading><chunk>In this section we show experiments and results with the four strategies proposed in the previous section. As discussed in the literature, there are not many parallel corpora available for Chinese- Spanish (Costa-juss` a et al., 2012). In this work, we use the data set from the United Nations (Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009). The training cor- pus contains about 60,000 sentences (and around 2 million words) and the development and test cor- pus contain 1,000 sentences each one. The base- line system is standard phrase-based SMT trained with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), with the default parameters. Table 2 shows results for the strategies 1, 2 and 3 in terms of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). From the BLEU scores, we see that strategy 1 gives slight improvements, but strategies 2 and 3 do not. Strategy System BLEU Baseline 32.29 1 +LM pos 32.54 2 Cascade 31.80 Zh2Es lemmas 36.40 Es lemmas 2Es 71.79 3 +Generation 32.11 Table 2: BLEU scores for Zh2Es translation task and different morphology strategies. Table 3 shows several oracles for strategy 4 with different morphology-based simplifications of Spanish. Best oracles are for lemmas. Then, we explore other simplifications, including lemmatiz- ing only: nouns (N), verbs (V), determiners (D), posesives (P) or adjectives (A). Non of these alter- natives approach the best oracle from lemmatizing all words. However, the interesting results are obtained when simplifying by number (num) and/or gen- der (gen). When simplifying number or gender, note that we use the information of lemmas and tags. When generalizing number, note that instead of using the information of singular (S) or plural (P) in the POS tag with the respective S or P, we use the generic N. Therefore, we generalize the in- formation of number. Similarly when generalizing gender or both (numgen). 58 Oracles get closer to the lemmas simplification when only simplifying both number and gender in Spanish. This finding is relevant in the sense that it simplifies the classification task in the further work that we are considering. System Oracles Baseline 32.29 Zh2Es lemmas 36.40 Zh2Es N lemmas 32.44 Zh2Es V lemmas 33.07 Zh2Es D lemmas 33.53 Zh2Es P lemmas 32.22 Zh2Es A lemmas 24.50 Zh2Es num 34.05 Zh2Es gen 33.36 Zh2Es numgen 35.80 Table 3: Oracles for different generalizations. In bold, the most interesting finding. Table 1 shows examples of all simplifications presented in previous Table 3. Note that simpli- fications in number and gender use lemmas plus POS tags to omit just the corresponding informa- tion that will need to be recovered in the classifi- cation stage. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Conclusions and Further Work </heading><chunk>This paper presents an ongoing work on enhacing a standard phrase-based SMT system by dealing with morphology. We have reported several strate- gies including adding POS language modeling, ex- perimenting with cascade systems and factored- based translation models. Only the first one re- ported improvements over the baseline. An addi- tional strategy consists of studying different Span- ish simplifications and then, generating the full- form with classification techniques. Experiments show that simplification only in gender and num- ber almost achieves improvements as good as the simplification on lemmas. This is an interesting result that reduces the level of complexity for the classification task. As further work, we will use classification techniques based on deep learning. </chunk></section><section><heading>Acknowledgements </heading><chunk>This work has been supported in part by Spanish Ministerio de Econom  a y Competitivi- dad, contract TEC2012-38939-C03-02 as well as from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER) and the Seventh Framework Pro- gram of the European Commission through the In- ternational Outgoing Fellowship Marie Curie Ac- tion (IMTraP-2011-29951).
