The primary point of dispute concerns the main predicate: Is the first predicate the root of the sentence, i.e. pao-de run, or is the second predicate the root, i.e. kuai fast? We demonstrate here that from a dependency grammar (DG) perspective, the second predicate should be taken as the root.

The point of contention is illustrated with the following DG analyses: (1) pao-de Wo kuai hen a. Wo pao-de hen kuai. (descriptive) I run -de very fast I run very fast. kuai Wo pao-de hen b. Wo pao-de hen kuai. (2) tiao-de Tamen lei hen a. Tamen tiao-de hen lei. (resultative) they jump-de very tired They jumped till they got very tired. lei Tamen tiao-de hen b. Tamen tiao-de hen lei. The a-analyses show the VERB-de as the root of the sentence, whereas the b-analyses show the adjective as the root? We argue for the b-analyses in this contribution. We will, though, also develop a somewhat more fine-grained de- pendency analysis of these constructions, i.e. more fine-grained than what is shown with (1b) and (2b) here. The point of contention reaches back decades. Early accounts of the de-construction were more in line with the b-analyses here (e.g. Chao 1968/1979: 176-180; Li 1986: 250), but in the 1980s an alternative account closer to the a-analyses gained a number of adherents (e.g. Huang 1988; Zhu 1982: 134; Zhou and Huang 1994:47, Ding 1961/1999: 635; Huang et al. 2009: 8491). Huangs (1988) article on the de-construction was particularly influential in establishing the validity of the a-analyses. Most of the relevant publications that have appeared more recently pursue an analysis similar to the a-analyses here (e.g. Xu and Pan 2014; Yang and Cheng 2013), though these publications diverge in the details. 1 Most explorations of the syntactic status of the de-construction have been produced in the 1 Fan (1993) proposes a tripartite demarcation: syntax, meaning, and pragmatics. The same one word can be viewed as a syntactic head but semantic dependent, or vice versa. That is, the syntactic root is different from the semantic/pragmatic root. This distinction is not observed in the DG account pursued here. 261 tradition of constituency grammar. Thus the two competing analyses just depicted with the trees in (12) are casting the debate in a new light. In- deed, to our knowledge the debate concerning the status of the de-construction in Mandarin has not yet been examined from a DG perspective. The interesting point about this situation is that from the DG perspective, the main question is less difficult insofar as the account is confronted with just two basic possibilities (a-trees vs. b-trees), and it need merely choose between these two. Constituency grammar accounts, in contrast, have the option to posit extra functional categories and the associated structure in order to accommodate specific facts about the de-construction. DG, with its minimal approach to basic sentence structure, cannot entertain the same multiplicity of potential analyses. This situation can be viewed either as a strength or weakness of the DG approach. Either the limitation on possibilities for analysis is a good thing because there is less room for disa- greement, or the possibilities are too limited and thus incapable of accommodating the multiplicity of facts associated with the construction. We of course prefer the former position. In any case, achieving certainty about the basic DG analysis of the de-construction should be beneficial for the further development of DG as applied to Mandarin. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Overview of de-elements </heading><chunk>The element de has a number of different uses in Mandarin. In general, there are at least six dif- ferent de-elements: 1. a. de marking a premodifier of a noun () b. de functioning as a nominalizer () 2. de/di marking premodifier of a verb () 3. de/dei should as a modal verb () 4. de receive as a content verb () 5. de possible as a modal particle () 6. a. de helping to express descriptive meaning () b. de helping to express resultative meaning () Mandarin orthography, i.e. the Hanzi characters, is a source of confusion when dealing with these de-elements. Hanzi distinguishes the first two de-elements from the other four with distinct characters, and , whereas the latter four de-elements are more difficult to discern due to the use of the same one Hanzi character, i.e. . The third de-element, the modal verb de/dei should, and the fourth de-element, the content verb de/dei get, receive, have a distinct sound pattern that distinguish them from the other four, i.e. de (rising tone) and dei (falling-rising tone), as opposed to de (neutral tone). The fifth de-element, the modal particle, is usually the second part of a three-part construction that con- sists of a verb, de, and a post-dependent on the verb. This postdependent is often a verb-like par- ticle, e.g. hua de xialai can slide down, kan de dao can see, cheng de qi can lift up. While these first five de-elements are cer- tainly worthy of exploration from a DG point of view, this contribution concentrates on the sixth de-element, which can be split into two types depending on whether de helps convey descrip- tive or resultative meaning. This sixth de-element has been the focus of significant debate, since its status in the syntactic hierarchy is not imme- diately clear, as suggested above with the trees in (12). A primary characteristic of descrip- tive/resultative de is that it appears as (what we view as) a clitic on a predicate (a verb or adjec- tive) and it precedes a second predicate (often an adjective). It is therefore often sandwiched be- tween two predicates. The following examples illustrate the descrip- tive and resultative de; they are taken from Li and Thompson (1981: 624ff.): (3) a. Ta zou-de hen man. Descriptive de S/he walk-de very slow. S/he walks very slowly. b. Women shui de hen hao. We sleep de very good We sleep very nicely. c. Ta chuan de hen piaoliang. he/she dress de very beautiful S/he dresses very beautifully. (4) a. Ta jiao de lei le. Resultative de s/he teach de tired le S/he taught herself tired. b. Wo ku de yanjing dou hong le. I cry de eye all red le I cried my eyes all red. 262 c. Wo e de fa huang. I hungry de produce panic Im hungry to the point of panic. When it helps convey descriptive meaning, de is associated with an adverb in English (here slowly, nicely, beautifully). When it helps convey resul- tative meaning, de is often associated with a pre- dicative adjective in English (here tired, red) or with a second verbal predicate (here produce). 2 As stated in the introduction, the main source of debate for these de-elements concerns the two predicates with which they co-occur: Is the first predicate (the one on the left) head over the second predicate, or vice versa. These two possi- bilities can be rendered in the English transla- tions as follows for example (3a): (5) Ta zou-de hen man. s/he walk-de very slow a. S/he walks very slowly. b. S/he is very slow in walking. While the translation S/he is very slow in walking is an odd sentence in English, this manuscript now argues that it more accurately reflects the hierarchy of words in the Mandarin sentence Ta zou de hen man. In other words, the second pre- dicate is in fact head over the first predicate. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Overview of diagnostics </heading><chunk>To motivate the dependency analyses of descrip- tive and resultative de, we use a number of diag- nostics: 1. Yes/no-questions with ma, 2. Position of the negation bu, 3. Omission, 4. Placement of the adverb ye also, 5. Questions with ne, and 6. Modal insertion To illustrate these diagnostics, we first apply them to the following sentence: (6) neng Ta tan qin Ta neng tan qin. S/he can play piano. 2 Even though the elements following de can be viewed as an adverb or adjective, worth noting is that with no formal marker, a Chinese word often allows for a flexible categorical role. Modal verbs such as neng here are widely taken to be the root of the clause in which they appear in many languages, and subordinating the subject immediately to the modal verb makes sense since doing so results in a hierarchy that corresponds exactly to the corresponding hierarchy for the English sentence, and further, it avoids the pro- jectivity violation that would be incurred if the subject were subordinated directly to the content verb tan. While these aspects of the analysis in (6) can be disputed, we take the validity of (6) for granted, since doing so allows us to establish a framework that can be used to analyze de-constructions. The validity of (6) is then sup- ported by the overall understanding of Mandarin sentence structure that emerges. Ma-questions: The answer to a yes/no-question that is formed with the interrog- ative particle ma is typically reduced down to just the root node, e.g. (7) Ta neng tan qin ma? s/he can play piano ma Can s/he play piano? a. Neng. Can. b. *Tan. Play. The answer is acceptable if it includes neng and unacceptable if it excludes neng. The assumption, then, is that the answer to a yes/no-question (ex- pressed using the interrogative particle ma) should include the root of the sentence. The negation bu: The negation bu typically precedes the root of the clause. Thus when bu is inserted into the test sentence, it should precede neng: (8) a. Ta bu neng tan qin. S/he not can play piano. She cannot play piano. b. Ta neng bu tan qin. S/he can not play piano. S/he may stop playing piano. Sentence (8a) is natural, whereas sentence (8b) is unusual. Sentence (8b) is only possible on the unlikely reading where it means that s/he is al- lowed to not play the piano (or to stop playing the piano). Thus the position of the negation helps identify the root of the sentence. To negate the entire sentence in a neutral manner, the nega- tion should precede the root node. Omission: Eliding or omitting a string is another test for identifying constituents (com- 263 plete subtrees). 3 (9) Wo neng tan qin. Ta ye neng. If a string can be omitted with- out significantly altering the meaning of the sen- tence, then the omitted string is potentially a constituent. In this case, tan qin can be omitted in terms of VP-ellipsis, whereby the meaning re- mains unchanged: I can play piano. S/he also can. I can play the piano, and she can, too. The ability to omit the string tan qin in the same manner that one can omit a verb phrase in terms of VP-ellipsis in English suggests that tan qin should form a constituent. This, in turn, suggests that neng is head over tan qin, because if it were not, tan qin would not qualify as a constituent, and omission should then not be possible. The adverb ye: The position of the adverb ye also is another indicator that is useful for iden- tifying the root of the sentence. This adverb must precede neng; it cannot follow neng: (10) a. Ta ye neng tan qin. S/he also can play piano. b. *Ta neng ye tan qin. S/he can also play piano. This pattern is accounted for on the assumption that ye must precede the root of the clause. In- serting ye is therefore a simple diagnostic that can help identify which predicate is head over the other. Ne-questions: The interrogative particle ne what about serves to form an abbreviated ques- tion of a sort. On the assumption that this particle focuses a constituent, it can be used to identify constituents in the preceding sentence and thus to identify which verb is head over the other: (11) a. A: Ta neng tan gangqin. S/he can play piano. B: Tan xiaotiqin ne? Play violin what about What about playing the violin? B: *Yinggai ne? What about should? The acceptability of the ne-question Tan xiaotiqin ne? is consistent with the stance that tan gangqin is a constituent, which is, in turn, consistent with the position of neng as head over tan gangqin. If neng were not head over tan 3 Following Hudson (1984: 92), Starosta (1988: 105), and Hellwig (2003: 603), we call the complete sub- trees of dependency structures constituents. gangqin but rather a dependent of tan, then tan gangqin would not be a constituent and we would expect the first question uttered by B to fail precisely because tan xiaotiqin would not correspond to a constituent in the preceding statement. The fact that the second ne-question is bad is consistent with the observation that as head over tan gangqin, the auxiliary neng is not a constituent. Modal insertion: The final diagnostic intro- duced here is modal insertion. This diagnostic inserts a modal auxiliary verb into a sentence that lacks one, e.g. (12) Ta tan qin. S/he plays piano. a. *Ta neng tan qin. neng can b. *Neng ta tan qin. c. *Ta tan neng qin. Given the non-controversial assumption that tan is the root of the sentence in (12), inserting the modal auxiliary neng into the sentence provides clues about the hierarchy. Since Mandarin is an SVO language, 4 The six diagnostics just illustrated will now be used to identify the root word in sentences containing de (descriptive and resultative de). The tests mostly converge, identifying the second predicate, i.e. the predicate that follows de as head over the first predicate. the root verb of a sentence should follow the subject and precede the object. This means that when the modal auxiliary is in- serted into the sentence, it becomes the root verb, and tan qin becomes its object in a sense. In oth- er words, when a modal is inserted into the sen- tence, it should follow the subject and precede what was the root before insertion. Doing this delivers helpful clues about the hierarchical structure of the sentence, as demonstrated with (12ac). </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Descriptive and resultative de </heading></section><section><heading>4.1 Descriptive de </heading><chunk>The six diagnostics just introduced will now be applied to descriptive de. Example (5) from above, repeated here as (13), is used as the test sentence: 4 We take Chinese to be an SVO language. However, there has been some debate about this. Some have argued that Chinese is actually SOV (e.g. Sun and Givon 1985, Chen 1995). 264 (13) Ta zou-de hen man. He walk-de very slow. He walks very slowly. Descriptive de helps express a characteristic abil- ity or trait associated with the subject. In this case, the characteristic trait is that of walking slowly. The six diagnostics will now be applied to this sentence, each in turn. The answer to a ma-question suggests that man is the root: (14) Ta zou-de man ma? S/he walk-de slow ma Does s/he walk slowly? a. *Man. Slow. b. *Zou-de. Walk. The placement of bu is consistent with the as- sumption that man is the root: (15) a. ? Ta bu zou-de man. s/he not walk-de slow b. ? Ta zou-de bu man. s/he walk not slow The ability to omit zou-de and the inability to omit hen man indicate that man is the root: (16) a. *Ta hen man. s/he very slow S/he is very slow. b. *Ta zou-de. s/he walk-de The placement of ye is consistent with man as the root, since in both of the following acceptable sentences, ye precedes man: (17) a. Ta ye zou-de hen man. s/he also walk-de very slow. b. Ta zou-de ye hen man. s/he walk-de also very slow The ability to form a ne-question corresponding to zou-de and the inability to form such a ques- tion corresponding to man suggest that man is the root: (18) A: Ta zou-de man. S/he walks slowly. B: Pao-de ne? What about run-de. B: *Kuai ne? What about quickly? And the fact that a modal verb can appear in two positions suggests that man is the root, since in both cases, the modal verb follows the subject and precedes man: (19) a. Ta neng zou-de hen man. s/he can walk-de very slow S/he can walk very slowly. b. Ta zou-de neng hen man. s/he walk-de can very slow S/he can walk very slowly. Note that if zou-de were head over man here, we would expect (19b) to be bad. Taken together, the six diagnostics strongly support the conclusion that man is the root of the sentence. The dependency-grammar analysis of the starting sentence should therefore be as fol- lows: (20) man Ta zou-de hen Ta zou-de hen man. The status of ta as a dependent of man as op- posed to as a dependent of zou-de is motivated by the omission diagnostic (see example 16a) and the modal insertion diagnostic (see example 19a). We can therefore see what the clitic de is doing in such cases: it serves to subordinate zou to man. </chunk></section><section><heading>4.2 Resultative de </heading><chunk>The tests also provide consistent results when applied to an example with resultative de. Exam- ple (4a) from above is repeated here as (21): (21) Ta jiao-de lei le. s/he taught-de tired le S/he taught her-/himself tired. This example differs from the one in the previous section insofar as the second predicate is now interpreted as the result of the action expressed by the first predicate, i.e. the teaching made her/him tired. The structure of the example, though, is similar to the structure of the example sentence from the previous section containing descriptive de. The answer to a ma-question suggests that lei is head over jiao-de: (22) Ta jiao-de lei le ma? S/he teach-de tired le ma Did s/he teach her-/himself tired? a. *Lei (le). Tired. b. *Jiao-de. Teach. The placement of bu (actually mei not in this case, due to interference associated with le) sug- gests that lei is the root, since in both of the fol- 265 lowing sentences, mei precedes lei: (23) a. Ta mei jiao-de lei. s/he not teach-de tired S/he did not teach her-/himself tired. b. Ta jiao-de mei lei. s/he teach-de not tired S/he did not teach her-/himself tired. If jiao-de were the root in this case, we would expect (23b) to be bad because a left-branching verb chain would be present verb chains in Mandarin are mostly right-branching. The ability to omit jiao-de and the inability to omit lei le indicate that lei is head over jiao-de: (24) a. *Ta lei le. s/he tired le b. *Ta jiao-de. s/he teach-de The placement of ye is consistent with lei as the root, since in both of the following acceptable sentences, ye precedes lei: (25) a. Ta ye jiao-de lei le. s/he also teach-de tired le S/he also taught her-/himself tired. b. Ta jiao-de ye lei le. s/he teach-de also tired le. S/he also taughter her-/himself tired. The ability to form a ne-question corresponding to jiao-de and the inability to form such a ques- tion corresponding to lei suggest that lei is head over jiao-de: (26) A: Ta jiao-de lei le. s/he teach-de tired le B: Xue-de ne? What about study? B: *Fan ne? What about bored? And the fact that a modal verb can appear in two positions suggests that lei is the root, since in both cases, the modal verb follows the subject and precedes lei: (27) a. Ta gai jiao-de lei le. s/he should teach-de tired le S/he should teach her-/himself tired. b. Ta jiao-de gai lei le. s/he teach-de should tired le S/he should teach her-/himself tired. Note that if jiao-de were head over lei here be- fore insertion of the modal verb, we would ex- pect (27b) to be bad because verb chains in Mandarin tend to be right-branching, not left-branching. Taken together, the six diagnostics support the conclusion that lei is head over jiao-de. The DG analysis of the starting sentence should therefore be as follows: (28) le lei Ta jiao-de Ta jiao-de lei le. s/he teach-de tired le. The status of ta as an immediate dependent of lei, as opposed to as a dependent of jiao-de, is sup- ported by the omission diagnostic (see example 24a) and the modal insertion diagnostic (see ex- ample 27a). Therefore we see again what de is accomplishing in such cases; its appearance serves to subordinate the first predicate to the second, i.e. jiao to lei. 4.3 de-clauses Resultative de also occurs in bi-clausal sentences. The following examples are unlike the examples in the previous two sections in this regard insofar as two clauses are present each time, as opposed to just one: (29) Ta ku-de yanjin hon le. s/he cry-de eyes red le Her/his crying makes her/his eyes red. The string ta ku-de can be evaluated as a clause as opposed to as a phrase because it contains the overt subject ta. The string ta ku-de is thus a clause that expresses the cause of the result ex- pressed with the main clause yanjin hon le. When yes/no questions with ma are applied to this sentence, the de-clause is most naturally omitted entirely: (30) Ta ku-de yanjing hong le ma? s/he cry-de eyes red le ma Does s/he cry her/his eyes red? a. Hong le. Red. b. Yanjing hong le. Eyes red. c. *Ku-de. Cry. These data are expected if hong is head over ku-de, but unexpected if ku-de were head over hong. Negation should be located in front of the second predicate, not in front of the first: 266 (31) a. *Ta bu ku-de yanjin hong e. s/he not cry-de eyes red le b. Ta ku-de yanjin bu hon le. s/he cry eyes not red le Crying makes her/his red eyes recover. The badness of (31a) is expected, since in order to negate the matrix clause, the negation should appear in the matrix clause, not in the subordi- nate clause. The structural analysis predicts that the sen- tence should be fine if the de-clause is omitted entirely, and this prediction is borne out: (32) Ta ku-de yanjin hon le. s/he cries-de eyes red le a. Yanjin hon le. Eyes red. b. ? Ta ku-de hon le. S/he cries red. c. ? Ta hon le. S/he is red. Sentence (32a), from which the de-clause has been removed entirely, is fine. If one attempts to remove the matrix subject yanjin eyes as in (32b), though, the result is marginal, and if one attempts to make ta s/he the matrix subject as in (32c), the meaning of the sentence changes drastically. Interestingly, however, ye can appear in the subordinate clause or the matrix clause: (33) a. Ta ye ku-de yanjin hon le. s/he also cry-de eyes red le She too cried her eyes red. b. Ta ku-de yanjin ye hon le. s/he cry-de eyes also red le S/he cried so that also her eyes were red. There may, however, be a slight meaning differ- ence across these two sentences, as indicated by the translations. The ne-question diagnostic identifies Ta ku-de as a constituent, which is expected if hon is head over ku-de: (34) A: Ta ku-de yanjin hon le. S/he cry-de eyes red le S/he cried her/his eyes red. B: Ni ku-de ne? What about you crying? The sixth diagnostic, modal insertion, is par- ticularly revealing. The modal verb gai should can be inserted into either clause: (35) a. Ta gai ku-de yanjin hon le. S/he should cry-de eyes red le S/he should cry making her eyes red. b. Ta ku-de yanjin gai hon le. s/he cry-de eyes should red le By crying her/his eyes should be red. The English translations indicate a subtle mean- ing difference across the two sentences. This meaning difference is expected insofar as the modal verb scopes just over the clause in which it appears. Taken together, the six diagnostics identify ta ku-de as a clausal constituent and hence as a de- pendent of hon. The following hierarchy models the data best: (36) le hon ku-de yanjin Ta Ta ku-de yanjin hon le. Thus if one wants to reflect the structure of this example with an English sentence, one might translate it as By her/his crying, her/his eyes were red. Perhaps the most important aspect of this analysis concerns the position of ta as a depen- dent of ku-de; ta is the subject ku-de, making ta ku-de a separate clause. The example is there- fore bi-clausal. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Verb copying </heading><chunk>The first verb in the de-construction, both de- scriptive and resultative, can, and at times must, be copied, e.g. (37) a. *Ta shuo hanyu-de hao. s/he speak Chinese-de good b. *Ta shuo-de hanyu hao. 5 s/he speak-de Chinese good c. Ta shuo hanyu shuo-de hao. s/he speak Chinese speak-de good S/he is good at speaking Chinese. Of these three sentences, only sentence (37c), in which the verb shuo is copied, is acceptable. The unacceptability of (37a) can be accounted for by the assumption that de must cliticize to a verb, as 5 Example (37b) is actually acceptable in the reading where it means Her/his spoken Chinese is good. On the intended reading however, i.e. She is good at speaking Chinese, the sentence is bad. 267 opposed to a noun, i.e. it cannot be a clitic on the noun hanyu. Why sentence (37b) is bad is, how- ever, not immediately clear, although it may have something to do with the fact that hanyu is trying to be a postdependent of shuo-de. Perhaps the appearance of de blocks the verb shuo from tak- ing postdependents. Verb copying would thus be a means of overcoming this block on postdepen- dents. The stance taken here is that verb copying as illustrated in (37c) is revealing something im- portant about the syntactic status of de. Much of the literature on the de-constructions takes de to be a suffix (e.g. Li and Thompson 1981). In con- trast, the observations that we now present sug- gest that de is better analyzed as a clitic. In par- ticular, it behaves like possessive s in English in an important way, which demonstrates that it is better viewed as a clitic, since possessive s in English has clitic status. First, consider (37b) again. While shuo-de cannot take hanyu as a postdependent, it can take hanyu as a predependent. Example (37b) is given again here as (38a) with the dependency analysis included, and sentence (38b) is added to illustrate the ability of shuo-de to take hanyu as a prede- pendent: (38) hao Ta shuo-de hanyu a. *Ta shuo-de hanyu hao. s/he speak-de Chinese good hao Ta shuo-de hanyu b. Ta hanyu shuo-de hao. s/he speak-de Chinese good If these analyses are on the right track, they point to a partial explanation for why verb copying occurs in the de-construction. Copying the verb helps to overcome the block on postdependents. Consider the following analysis of example (37c), repeated here as (39) with the dependen- cies added (39) hao Ta shuo-de shuo hanyu Ta shuo hanyu shuo-de hao. s/he speak Chinese speak-de good On this analysis, shuo-de no longer has a post- dependent, but rather hanyu is a postdependent of the first shuo. The account might therefore simply stipulate that the appearance of de blocks its host from taking a postdependent. This stipu- lation would, however, be contradicted by other data, a point that will become evident shortly. The analysis of descriptive and resultative de above has demonstrated that de serves to subor- dinate one predicate to another. It behaves like a postposition or post-subordinator. To accommo- date this role of de, it can be positioned as the root of the entire premodifier. As the root of this modifier, it has a hierarchical status that is quite similar to the possessive clitic s in English. Compare the following structures: (40) dog -s woman the with hat a the woman with a hat s dog (41) hao Ta -de shuo Ta shuo -de hao. s/he speaks -de good S/he speaks well. The de element is now shown as the root of the phrase shuo de, similar to the way that posses- sive s is shown as the root of the determiner phrase the woman with a hats. Both of these elements are granted the status of a clitic. Clitics are, following Gro (2014), indicated with a hyphen and the absence of a projection line. The hyphen appears on the side of the clitic where its host is, indicating that the clitic is pro- sodically dependent on that host. The host of de must be a verb (here shuo), whereas the host of s can be most any category (here it is the noun hat). The analysis of the de element just sketched is supported by cases in which the verb to which it cliticizes is subordinated to a modal verb, e.g. 268 (42) ku -de women hui Ta chang Ta hui chang -de women ku. S/he can sing -de we cry S/he can sing (so nicely that) we cry. The de cliticizes to chang at the same time that chang is subordinate to hui. This analysis grants de the status of a subordinator (subordinate con- junction). It serves to subordinate the imme- diately preceding predicate to the following pre- dicate. To summarize, the verb copying phenomenon has helped reveal important traits of descriptive and resultive de. This element is a clitic that serves to subordinate one predicate to another. It necessarily cliticizes to the preceding predicate and subordinates that predicate to a following predicate. The fact that it cliticizes to a preceding predicate blocks that predicate from taking a postdependent. This is in turn the aspect of de that is responsible for motivating verb copying. By copying the verb, the first instance of the verb (on the left) can take a postdependent. </chunk></section><section><heading>6 Unification with de () and de () </heading><chunk>Descriptive/resultative de () shares an impor- tant prosodic feature with de () and de (). All three de receive a neutral tone although does allow an archaic falling tone at times, in which case it is pronounced as di. The shared trait of a neutral tone suggests that all three de can be viewed as clitics. More importantly, though, all three de serve to subordinate what immediately precedes them to what follows them. In other words, their roles in the syntactic struc- ture are closely similar. The most frequently occurring de often subor- dinates material to a noun; it is written as , and the material that it subordinates typically corresponds to an attributive adjective, preposi- tional phrase, or relative clause in English, e.g. (43) juzi -de xiao a. xiao -de juzi small -de orange small oranges shu -de shang shujia b. shujia shang -de shu shelf on -de book the book on the shelf In each case, the de clitic appears to subordinate the material preceding it to the noun that follows it. The other de () performs a closely similar role, although it depends on a verb as opposed to on a noun, and the material that it subordinates is restricted to an adjective. It therefore serves to transform an adjective into an adverb; the adjec- tive is often doubled: (44) zuo Ta -de zai jing-jing nar Ta jing-jing -de zuo zai nar. she quietly -de sat at there 'She quietly sat there. In sum, the aspect to acknowledge about all three de is that they are quite similar. They are clitics that subordinate what precedes them to what follows them. The point, then, is that a uni- fied syntactic analysis of the three de is possible. </chunk></section><section><heading>7 Conclusion </heading><chunk>This manuscript has produced a DG account of the descriptive/resultative element de ( ) in Mandarin. This element is a clitic that serves to subordinate the preceding predicate to the/a fol- lowing predicate. Its role in syntax is closely similar to the roles of de () and de (). All three de perform a translative function (Tesniere 1959: Part III). This manuscript ends with a word of caution. The exploration of de elements here has focused on a particular type of de, namely descriptive and resultative de (), and it has drawn a parallel to two other types of de, and . The de ele- ment appears in additional constructions beyond these three, as mentioned above in the overview where six types of de were listed. The three types of de in the overview not examined in this con- tribution behave much differently than the three types of de that have been considered. Especially the modal element de (the fifth de in the list) presents challenges to syntactic theory. 269 Literature Yuen-Ren Chao. 1968/1979. A Grammar of Spoken Chinese. Translated by Lv Shuxiang.
