We are very pleased to have as invited speaker Bernardo Magnini from FBK/irst, Trento, Italy. Bernardo has a long history of building superb NLP software systems that reflect a deep understanding of nature of language. As before, the workshop is primarily structured around interactive discussions, guided by examples. We scheduled three main questions for discussion: Definition and categorization of events and other inter-event relations: What are events, states, and eventualities? How best to represent and organize events? What relations obtain between events? Discussions of coreference and the other relations that link them, such as cause and precondition, deepening questions left unanswered in the prior workshops. Discussion leader: Palmer. Event mentions: When exactly is an event mentioned? How many events occur in complex mentions such as they shot the snake dead? How should aspectuals and event modifiers be best treated? When are two events the same? Discussions of ongoing event mention annotation and the complexities of the annotation rules. Discussion leader: Hovy. Complex event structure and scripts: How can complex event structures be decomposed? How can one identify subevents of complex vents, and order them into scripts? Where do event scripts begin and end? How do they relate to participants and their goals? The manual and automated creation of event scripts, evinced by increasing interest in automated event induction in the HLT community. Discussion leader: Mitamura. This workshop continues the previous format by including a poster session to showcase projects from around the world. We received excellent submissions, contained in this volume. iii Organizers: Eduard Hovy, Carnegie Mellon University Teruko Mitamura, Carnegie Mellon University Martha Palmel, University of Colorado Program Committee: Dan Bikel, Google Inc.
