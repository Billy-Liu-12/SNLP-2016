Language with informal tone, typical in much web content, poses a challenge and provides illuminating case studies for the analysis of the use of hedges. We have analysed conversations from a web forum and identified the manners individuals express hedging through expressions which differ slightly regarding to their lexical form from hedges used in formal writing. Based on these observations, we propose an annotation scheme composed of three main categories of hedges where the main class comprises first person epistemic expressions that explicitly note an individuals involvement in what they express. We provide here an overview of our insights obtained by annotating a dataset of web forum posts according to this scheme. These observations will be useful in the design of automatic methods for the detection of hedges in texts in informal language. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>This paper presents an annotation scheme for hedging focused on epistemic modality expressions in informal language. Hedges are used by a speaker to modulate the degree of commitment expressed by his or her statements. Hedging is deployed within various speaker states such as uncertainty, possibility, or politeness. A number of schemes have been proposed directly or indirectly to annotate hedges. The elements involved in a hedging event occurring in a sentence are: the hedging expression, the source and scope of the hedge. The source refers to the entity experiencing or/and expressing the mental state represented by the hedge. The scope refers to the sentential constituents that are affected by a hedge expression. In (1), the hedges might and may are linked to their respective scopes. The source corresponding to both hedges, although only implicit in the sentence, is the sentences author. (1) These findings might be chronic and may represent reactive airways disease. SCOPE-OF-MIGHT SCOPE-OF-MAY Most existing annotation schemes label hedges as single units, while a minority have studied more complex classifications of hedges. Bioscope is among the corpora which scheme is in the first group (Szarvas et al., 2008). Bioscope is a biomedical dataset of sentences from medical and biomedical articles tagged with speculation and negation information. Minimal units in a sentence are annotated as expressing hedging or negation, if such phenomena occur, and discuss cases where these lexical units are not actually used to imply spec- ulation/negation. They noted that keywords differ in their propensity to be speculative depending on the domain. Ganter and Strube (2009) exploited the concept of weasel word in Wikipedia to semi- automatically build a dataset of hedges. Weasel words comprise expressions that Wikipedia editing poli- cies discourage, such as some people say, it is believed, many are of the opinion, most feel, research has shown, etc. Vincze (2013) divided speculative cues in this Wikipedia dataset into three types: weasels, hedges and peacocks. Weasels signal uncertainty regarding an argument identity. For instance, the un- certainty in some other is caused by the lack of specification in While the Skyraider is not as iconic as some other aircraft. . . . Hedges follow the regular conception limited to expressing uncertainty. Pea- cocks signal various sorts of subjective judgements such as ardent and most distinguished. In the second group there are the works of Rubin et. al. (2010), Wiebe et al. (2005) and Hyland (1998), to mention few important ones. Rubin (2010) proposed a multi-dimensional certainty annotation model, where the main dimension qualifies expressions according to five categories that range from total uncertainty to total certainty. Wiebe et al. (2005); Wilson and Wiebe (2005) place speculation within a larger and more complex framework for annotation of opinions. This annotation was centred on the concept of Private States; i.e. they are not open to observation or verification, and they comprise opinions, beliefs, thoughts, feelings, emotions, goals, evaluations, and judgements and speculations. Hyland (1998) proposed a categorization taxonomy of hedges in scientific articles according to their function as: content-oriented, reader-oriented or writer-oriented. We studied hedges in informal language in a dataset of web forum posts, but some issues emerged when attempting to annotate hedges according to conceptions in the aforementioned approaches. In Section 2, we provide an overall description of these issues. Our attempts to address these issues led us to propose a categorization scheme for hedges in language with informal tone which is described in Section 3. In Section 4, we present a summary of our findings from analysis and manual annotation in the dataset of forum posts, and in Section 5, we present our conclusions and views for future work. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Problem description </heading><chunk>In this section we describe some issues related to the annotation of hedges in texts from an informal language type. The web forum from which posts were extracted belongs to a commercial software vendor; it is a forum in which users look to other users for advice in solving their software-related issues. Most of annotation schemes mentioned in the previous section focus uniquely on the identification of a hedge and its scope in texts of formal tone and are only concerned with the interpretation of hedges as speculative signals. Automatic approaches for the identification of speculation (that implies automatic annotation of hedges) such as used by Light et al. (2004), Medlock and Briscoe (2007) and Farkas et al. (2010) follow the same line by targeting academic articles. Few approaches address annotation in informal register texts (Vincze et al. (2014) provide an exception). However, the informal texts of online web fora typically do not benefit from rounds of editing: the text is typically noisy. Noisy text often contains ungrammatical language, misspellings, typos and non-linguistic strings (like emoticons), which limit the efficacy of natural language processing tools and methods (that perform moderately in well-formed text) when applied to texts with such informal language. Despite acceptance that uncertainty expressed in a proposition is partly a product of reporting other points of view, as in (2), only few approaches such Rubin (2010), Wiebe et al. (2005) and Hendrickx et al. (2012) address the annotation of the hedging source, and none of the projects for automatic detection of hedges also address the detection of the hedging source. Disregard for the source follows from the fact that regardless of who the speculation experiencer is, a hedge is worth identifying since it points out to non-factual information. (2) The existence of such an independent mechanism has also been suggested in mammals. This approach can be thought of as content-centered. Potentially, also identifying the experiencer of the hedging event could aid the building of the statements such as Individual A knows X and has certainty about it or Individual B does not know whether X, and the like. This would be a user-centered approach since explores the qualities and properties of a writers utterances to find out whether a hedging expression reflects the writers perspective or not. In a domain of web forum posts generated by forum participants, the kind of expressions used to con- vey hedging are slightly different from hedges such as suggest, potential, likely, and may used frequently in more formal contexts. Informal expressions of hedging include phrasal expressions, acronyms and spoken-register transcriptions (e.g. not sure, IMO (In My Opinion), AFAIK (As Far As I Know), dunno). When the hedging experiencer is explicit in these sentences, this fact is lexically realized with the use of first person expressions such as I am not sure, My opinion, IMO or to me, it looks like in sentences (3), (4), (5) and (6) respectively. 1 These sentences convey the forum post writers direct involvement in the hedging phenomenon, which is revealed by the use of I as subject, the first-person possessor in IMO for In My Opinion, or by the pronoun me. This sort of phrasal hedges can also appear in a discontinuous manner in a sentence such as I think in (7). (3) I am not sure which SP is on here, or how to check. Post: 18706 (4) Id suggest the following additional steps: Post: 3655 (5) IMO it is best to always leave tamper protection on to prevent threats Post: 16687 (6) To me, it looks like the O/P wants to try out the 2011 beta for testing Post: 15134 (7) I dont know how its in other countries, but think it s almost the same </chunk></section><section><heading>I THINK </heading><chunk>Post: 35934 Our research seeks insights that contribute in both content and user-centered studies of hedging. Therefore, our development of an annotation scheme and subsequent analysis take into account both perspectives. To this end, features the annotation scheme should consider are: a) identification of the hedging source, b) identification of the scope, c) domain-generality of annotated expressions, d) inclusion of different interpretations of hedging, e) functionality with noisy text, and d) capacity to annotate non- contiguous hedging elements in a sentence. 3 A scheme for hedging in informal language The annotation scheme was built around three elements: Entities, Relations and Attributes. Entities are used to represent: a) a hedge, b) its source c) its scope, d) non-hedge and e) other discourse markers. Re- lations are used to link the hedge entities with their source or scope. Attributes are additional information about hedge entities that can be filled in during the annotation process. We address three main types of hedges: a) Single-hedges, b) Not-Claiming-Knowledge epistemic phrases and c) Syntactic hedges. These are described in next sections. An additional label, Non-hedge, marks entities that were deemed as potential hedges but not actually used in any hedging sense. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.1 Single hedges </heading><chunk>This hedge category corresponds to the traditional conception of hedges as single words conveying un- certainty. They are usually modal and lexical verbs expressing epistemic modality such as may, appear and suggest. The initial lexicon of single hedge instances considered for manual annotation were ex- tracted from Rubins (2010) work. Some lexical items such as can not know and dont understand 1 The number preceded by Post in examples throughout this paper corresponds to the post identification number for the forum post in the data set from which the example was extracted. could overlap with Not-Claiming-Knowledge (NCK) epistemic phrases, but they are only deemed as NCK expressions if they are associated to a first person pronoun in the sentence. 3.2 Source We define two categories of Source for a hedging expression: a) Inner Epistemic Source and b) Outer Epistemic Source. The Outer Epistemic Source is always the posts writer, as the writer selects a state- ments content. The Inner Epistemic Source corresponds to the entity whose hedged point of view is expressed in the sentence; thus, the Inner Epistemic Source can be the writer or not. The use of suggest and suggested in examples (8) and (9), respectively, illustrates these two categories. (8) USER1: [...] Id suggest the following additional steps: . . . (9) USER2: User1 suggested following some steps, and you should consider [...] In (8), USER1 is the one asserting his/her own hedged point of view. In this case, the Inner Epistemic Source is attributed to USER1, while in (9) it is attributed to USER1 despite the fact that USER2 is the propositions author. In cases where the writer express his/her own point of view in the hedging event, the Outer Epistemic Source coincides with the Inner Epistemic Source as in (8). When the Source is not explicit in the sentence, it can occur either implicitly as in (10) or as subject ellipsis as in (11). 2 Particularly, web forum text is prone to subject ellipsis due to its informal style. (10) [...] some sort of malware might be preventing you from seeing the stock quotes. (11) and subject dont know if this is the correct place to ask it so pls lemme know if i shud ask elsewhere on the forum [...] The implementation of the annotation scheme we describe here provides the means for marking the different cases when the Inner Epistemic Source is explicit or not. 3.3 Scope In this research, scope annotation is mainly focused on the syntactic dependency head of the phrase affected by the hedge. This means that our approach to annotating the hedging scope is not as strict as it might be: at least the syntactic head of the scope has to be annotated and linked to the entity representing the corresponding hedging expression. This is mainly due to the inherent complexity of identifying a particular clause boundaries inside a sentence. In our annotation scheme, the scope is separated from the hedging entity and linked to it by a SCOPE- OF relationship as in example (12). This has the advantage of avoiding the marking of extra words that do not belong to the scope. For instance for (12), Szarvas et al. (2008) by including the hedge possible within the scope boundaries, tag however as part of the scope. 3 (12) Atelectasis in the right mid zone is , however, possible. SCOPE-OF-POSSIBLE 3.4 Epistemic phrases This category includes first person epistemic phrases: they typically contain a first person subject, an epistemic verb such as such as I think, I suppose and I wonder, and a complement clause is embedded under the epistemic modality in this kind of phrase. In this section, we show how the concept of first person epistemic phrases moves away from the conceptualization of hedges coming from the epistemic modality tradition. 2 Here, subject is used to signal an unexpressed but interpreted subject. 3 This is done to keep the hedge linked to its scope. This way of representing the relation was chosen because of limitations in the annotation tools they were using (Szarvas et al., 2008). Early discussion about interpreting epistemic phrases as hedges originated in the analysis I think. Particularly, Thompson and Mulac (1991) consider this epistemic phrase has achieved a hedging state through a process of grammaticalization. Their view is that I think is roughly similar to maybe when used to express the degree of speaker commitment, thus comprising a grammatical sub-category of adverbs. Scheibman (2001), K  arkk  ainen (2010) and Wierzbicka (2006) showed that first person epistemic phrases used to express personal stance are highly frequent in various registers in contemporary English. They also describe particular properties of these phrases such as: a) representing the speakers attitude with respect to the subsequent piece of discourse in contrast to when third person is used, there the piece of discourse is seen as a description (Scheibman, 2001), b) it comprises explicitly subjective claims in contrast to impersonal expressions where the hedging source is obscure (Hyland, 1998) , c) used to express knowledge states, as a boundary marker for turn-taking in conversation, a speakers perspective marker, and as a way to align the speakers with the listeners stance (K  arkk  ainen, 2010). Besides, Wierzbicka (2006) suggests that this category of phrases merits recognition as a major grammatical and semantic class in modern English. She acknowledges a rigorous semantic and cultural contextual analysis of each type would be needed to provide an accurate interpretation, which she does in part. A preliminary examination of hedge expression in our dataset showed that writers use first person singular epistemic phrases exhibiting characteristics mentioned above. Expressions of hedging such as Id suggest, I assumed, I am not sure and IMO (In My Opinion) (see (14b), (15b), (3) and (16)) emphasize the writers involvement in a proposition. In this aspect, they are different from epistemic phrases that have second and third person subjects as They didnt know in (13b). Annotating these expressions according to the traditional conceptualization of hedges would not capture the subjectivity expressed in epistemic phrases. This would result in annotating only the lexical verbs suggest, assumed in (14b) and (15b) in a similar manner as they would in (14a) and (15a); or in terms of epistemic phrases only didnt know would be annotated in (13a) which makes of this annotation equivalent to the one in (13b). The difference with epistemic modals is also relevant as they act as verbal modifiers, and even in first person subject propositions as in (18) the main constituent is the predicate they hedge. On the other hand, first person epistemic phrases are more subjective in the sense that the subjects involvement (revealed by the use of first person pronouns) is emphasized by the main constituent of these epistemic phrases (predicates related to mental states). 4 (13) a. I didnt know what else to do and I still dont. Post: 288960 b. They didnt know the file and recommended to kill the process. Post: 4452 (14) a. . . . and some researchers suggest that fibromyalgia and CFS are related. b. Id suggest the following additional steps: Post: 3655 (15) a. and it is assumed that he learned to read and write at the local parish school. b. I assumed I would be able to retrieve all my files, but so far - no such luck. Post: 7492 (16) This is a kind censorship, IMO. Post: 171336 (17) I for one think the best course of action to take when you believe you are . . . Post: 16687 (18) As I learn more about the problem I may ask for more info. Post: 25545 We believe first person epistemic phrases reach the same level of grammaticization as I think showed by Thompson and Mulac (1991), so matching only the main lexical component expressing hedg- ing would only partially represent the writers commitment. The frequency and variety of epistemic phrases to be detailed in Section 4 support these intuitions. Furthermore, matching hedging expressions that resemble traditional hedges and that are not epistemic phrases is not always possible; that is the cases of IMO and AFAIK. Both acronyms reinforce our hypothesis that epistemic phrases are a distinc- tive grammaticalized category of hedges since they stand for the first-person epistemic phrases In My Opinion and As Far As I Know respectively, and even the case of IDK standing for I dont know. 4 In Section 4 the main types of first person epistemic phrases are characterized according to their main constituent. In some cases additional epistemic phrases modifiers modulate the intensity the subjective force, as in I for one think in (17). 5 However, we have not yet addressed degrees of certainty in hedging. We reckon these expressions and the like constitute units of meaning with distinctive hedging quali- ties, and we aim to provide theoretical support to account for them as a newly grammaticized category of hedges. Ensuring that the writer is the one experiencing the mental state expressed by a hedge is highly relevant. One of the goals of this research is finding ways the epistemic source of a hedging event can be easily identified. We propose first person singular and plural epistemic phrases as hedge category when the subject of the epistemic experience is relevant to be identified. In Section 4 we provide over- all description of our findings around these phrases that we call of Non-Claiming-Knowledge (NCK) epistemic phrases. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.5 Syntactic hedges </heading><chunk>Syntactic hedges constitute the third category of hedges we propose, given structural differences on the sentence level from Single-hedges and NCK hedges. We have considered in this study the classification of conditionals made by Iatridou (1991) (relevance, factual and hypothetical conditionals), and we have have applied tests proposed by her to manually identify which conditionals convey hedging. For instance, the writer is not expressing uncertainty in (19) about the interlocutor wanting to ask questions, but the speech act taking place is for making him or her aware that he would answer in case when further questions arise. The use of if in the previous example differs from its use in (20), where it helps to state a hypothesis. (19) If you have any questions, feel free to ask. (20) Im curious what your system profile is, and if there is a potential incompatibility here. In the annotation task at hand, it is not possible to have access to complete dialogue that takes place starting with a question, comment or announcement. Having access to the full text written where the conditional occurs might enable one to determine if this corresponds to the hypothetical type of conditional. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that the amount of effort involved on deciding about the speech act qualities of conditionals increases the time required by manual annotation. </chunk></section><section><chunk>4 Findings in annotation of hedges in a web forum dataset  Our annotation dataset was composed of 3,000 web forum posts, from which interrogative sentences, quotations and non-processable sentences 6 were dropped out, leaving a total of 16,720 sentences. To ease the manual annotation task, an initial set of hedge expressions was used to pre-annotate this dataset; however, the final set of hedging expressions surpassed in number and variety this initial set. In this dataset, we found 790 unique types of hedges, 272 of them belong to the Single hedge category, 300 to NCK phrases, 8 to Syntactic and 210 to miscellaneous hedges. In Table 1, we show some frequent types of Single hedges and NCK epistemic phrases. Recall that we think the annotation scheme should be able to identify the stance of the author of annotated sentences. Thus, the first person pronouns I, we, me and possessive pronoun my were targeted to identify (NCK) epistemic phrases. We have classified these phrases in three categories: a) Primary epistemic phrases, b) Semantically extended epistemic phrases, and c) Lexically extended epistemic phrases. The annotation scheme does not exhaust this taxonomy, however these categories are relevant to give a characterization of epistemic phrases found in an informal domain style. The Primary type of epistemic phrase are expressions composed of a subject and an epistemic lexical verb conveying speculation as a main verb. I think and I hope in Table 1 are some examples of this kind of phrases. In these examples, the main verb can be categorized as a Single-hedge; it could be identified by 5 We are aware that think may have a non-speculative reading in this sentence. </chunk></section><section><chunk>6 Non-processable sentences are mostly noisy text composed by non linguistic tokens.

They reflect the variety of hedge types in the dataset. 2 This is a condensed set of hedge types provided for the sake of brevity. an algorithm aiming to detect hedging based on traditional hedges. The Semantically Extended epistemic phrase category contains phrases equivalent in meaning to the Primary types: the main lexical verb do not necessarily convey uncertainty, but as a whole the phrase conveys uncertainty, such as in I dont know. For instance, know is an epistemic verb but does not convey a sense of uncertainty and as it is not used for hedging. The negated counterparts of such verbs are equivalent to a primary type of epistemic verb conveying uncertainty as in (Holmes, 1988) not know is categorized as an epistemic verb expressing epistemic modality. Nonetheless, we can easily see that negating know is quite versatile, e.g. never/seldom/hardly/scarcely know, improbable (that) (personal pronoun) know(s), hard to know, etc. The same versatility can be thought of the case of remember and see. Informal contractions such as dunno are included in this category. To this category also belong objective epistemic phrases also known as non-factives (eg. understand) which do not presuppose the factivity of the embedded proposition. The lexically extended epistemic phrase category includes phrases where the main epistemic compo- nent is not a verb, but the epistemic force is conveyed by another constituent such as a noun or adjective such as I am hopeful see Table 1. Other NCK phrases are AFAIK, IMO, and I am not sure. Some normalization techniques reduced the number of lexically extended epistemic phrases to pri- mary type in the case of NCK, and in both Single and NCK categories normalization causes grouping of equivalent types; in Table 1 these groups and their normalized type are shown. Normalization strate- gies address a) standard and non-standard abbreviations, b) contractions, c) typographical errors and misspellings, d) tense and number variations, e) colloquial forms, and f) inclusion of modifiers. Single hedges were normalized from 272 to 189 types and NCK were normalized from 300 to 137. Some of these groups have particularly a broad range of types such as the group for I do not know which has 20 different lexical types of NCK epistemic phrases, including colloquial forms such as dunno and donno. We believe that these normalisation techniques and normalized groupings are useful to design strategies for the automatic detection of hedges in informal language styles. Syntactic hedges comprise seven lexical types such as if, or and when composing a total of 1,307 occurrences. A fourth category comprises miscellaneous hedges that could not be classified as any of the former categories. In this group, 314 occurrences are spread over 210 types ( 1.5 occurrences per type). They are expressions such as fingers crossed, numerical ranges and NCK-like phrases that are specifically related to the main discussion topic in the web forum such as I am not a techie, and I am technically challenged. We kept this kind of phrases aside because we wanted to ensure the set of NCK phrases is topic-neutral. Regarding other annotated entities, we found that 3.57% (286 occurrences) of hedges have a source that is not the writer of the sentence where the hedge is used. Although minimal, this shows the existence of cases where the mental state expressed by a hedge use does not reflect the writers one. Occurrences of hedges without scope associated to them such as somebody and confusion make up to 18.26% (1,496) of overall cases. Further analysis of these cases would be needed to determine if their presence in a sentence changes the value of certainty conveyed by it. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Concluding remarks </heading><chunk>This paper presented an annotation scheme of hedges for informal language, where the main category is constituted by first person epistemic expressions (see Appendix A for a specification of the annotation scheme elements). We have shown that this kind of expressions has a distinctive character in the expres- sion of hedging, different from hedges in form of epistemic modals and other hedges commonly used in texts that have a formal register. The variety of forms in these phrases reveals this is a relevant category of hedging in domains with informal registers, such as web fora. The expressions characterized here provide structures that can be exploited for the automatic identification of hedges in noisy text, where automatic deep grammatical characterisation is a tough problem. Distinctions between NCK phrases and epistemic phrases with subjects other than first person, and other classes of hedges in first person constructions were drawn. Both kind of distinctions focus on the writers involvement in a hedging event. We have proposed the annotation of scope in a way that sentence constituents unrelated to hedging can be excluded in annotation, which we believe contributes to the precision of scope annotation. There are many paths of future research, mainly, finding a way to assess the hedging quality of the expressions found so far by additional independent judges. This was not done this so far, because it requires spe- cialized knowledge about the domain and because the annotation process has so far been exploratory in verifying whether Not-Claiming-Knowledge epistemic phrases are a prevailing category of hedges in the informal register used in web forums. Another path for further development is the automation of some techniques manually done so far in a way detection of hedges can be done in noisy texts. </chunk></section><section><heading>6 Acknowledgements </heading><chunk>This research is supported by the Science Foundation Ireland CNGL (Grant 07/CE/I1142) as part of the Centre for Next Generation Localisation (www.cngl.ie) at Trinity College Dublin and by the Trinity College Research Scholarship Program.
