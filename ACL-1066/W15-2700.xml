This workshop takes place for the first time, with the goal of gathering and showcasing theoretical and computational approaches to joint models of semantics, and applications that incorporate multi-level semantics. Improved computational models of semantics hold great promise for applications in language technology, be it semantics at the lexical level, sentence level or discourse level. Large-scale corpora with corresponding annotations (word senses, propositions, attributions and discourse relations) are making it possible to develop statistical models for many tasks and applications. However, developments in lexical and sentence-level semantics remain largely distinct from those in discourse semantics. This workshop aims to bridge this gap. Our goal is to gather and showcase theoretical and computational approaches to joint models of semantics, and applications that incorporate multi-level semantics. This workshop will serve as a venue for dialog between researchers from various areas: linguists and cognitive scientists working on aspects of representing text with multiple levels of semantics, machine learning researchers interested in joint inference over different types of semantic cues, and also researchers who are interested in applications which require multi-level semantics. We received 24 papers in total, out of which we accepted 12. These papers are presented as talks at the workshop as well as in a poster session. In addition, the workshop program features talks from three invited speakers who work on different aspects of computational semantics. The day will end with a panel session where invited speakers and workshop participants further discuss the insights gained during the workshop. Our program committee consisted of 32 researchers who provided constructive and thought- ful reviews. This workshop would not have been possible without their hard work. Many thanks to you all. Finally, a huge thank you to all the authors who submitted papers to this workshop and made it a big success.
