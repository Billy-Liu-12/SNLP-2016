At the Lexicon-Grammar Interface: The Case of Complex Predicates in the Functional Generative Description V  aclava Kettnerov  a and Mark  eta Lopatkov  a Charles University in Prague Faculty of Mathematics and Physics Czech Republic {kettnerova,lopatkova}@ufal.mff.cuni.cz Abstract Complex predicates with light verbs have proven to be very challenging for syntactic theories, particularly due to the tricky dis- tribution of valency complementations of light verbs and predicative nouns (or other predicative units) in their syntactic struc- ture. We propose a theoretically adequate and economical representation of complex predicates with Czech light verbs based on a division of their description between the lexicon and the grammar. We demon- strate that a close interplay between these two components makes the analysis of the deep and surface syntactic structures of complex predicates reliable and efficient. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>Description of a language system is usually di- vided into two basic components a grammar and a lexicon. The grammar consists of general pat- terns of a natural language rendered, in the form of formal rules which are applicable to whole classes of language units. The lexicon, on the other hand, represents an inventory of language units with their specific properties. Nevertheless, linguistic theories can substantially differ from each other in the distribution of information between the gram- mar and the lexicon. Valency, which forms the core of a dependency structure of a sentence, constitutes a fundamen- tal example of a phenomenon bridging between the grammar and the lexicon. Valency struc- ture of verbs is so varied that it cannot be de- scribed by rules; it must be listed in lexical entries in a lexicon, see the highly elaborated lexicons, e.g., (Mel cuk and Zholkovsky, 1984), (Apresjan, 2011). However, if a verb is a part of a com- plex predicate, its valency structure is involved in a complex structure the formation of which is typ- ically regular enough to be described by rules in the grammar. In this paper, we focus on lexicalized co- occurrence relations, namely on complex pred- icates composed of light verbs and predicative nouns (CPs) where two syntactic elements serve as a single predicate, e.g., to make a request, to give a presentation, to get support, to take a shower. 1 We demonstrate that an adequate and economical description of CPs requires a close co- operation of the grammar and the lexicon: On the basis of the lexical representation of CPs, gram- matical rules generate well-formed (both deep and surface) dependency structures. The objective of this contribution is to further elaborate and modify in light of recent inves- tigations the theoretical results given in (Ket- tnerov  a and Lopatkov  a, 2013). Namely, the lex- ical information provided by the VALLEX lexi- con (Lopatkov  a et al., 2008) on diatheses and the grammatical rules in the grammatical component are applied to the description of CPs in marked structures of diatheses (e.g., passive structures) with the aim to gain all surface syntactic manifes- tations of the CPs. The paper is structured as follows: first we discuss related work on CPs (Sect. 2); then we briefly introduce the Functional Generative De- scription (FGD) (Sgall et al., 1986) used as the theoretical background and the VALLEX lexicon (Sect. 3) and describe the lexical representation of CPs (Sect. 4); finally, we provide the enhancement of the grammatical component of FGD with for- mal rules for the generation of the syntactic struc- tures with CPs (Sect. 5). </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Related Work </heading><chunk>There is a variety of approaches to complex pred- icates with light verbs (also called light verb con- 1 Causative constructions of the type to make sb do some- thing are not considered here as CPs. 191 structions) and their characteristics, as well as to the range of issues involved in the notion of complex predicates. Despite the diversity in the treatment of complex predicates in different the- oretical frameworks, there is a general agree- ment that the crucial issue to be resolved is that two syntactic elements function as a single pred- icate; this fact is corroborated by the presence of a single Agens/Bearer of action or proper- ty/Experiencer. This key characteristic of com- plex predicates of the given type is accounted for by the mechanisms called argument fusion (Butt, 1998), argument transfer (Grimshaw and Mester, 1988), or argument composition (Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1990) formulated within different the- ories. All these mechanisms try to account for the fact that (i) light verbs, despite being depleted of semantic participants (denoting only general se- mantic scenario), have valency complementations, and that (ii) semantic participants (contributed to CPs primarily by predicative nouns) are usu- ally expressed as complementations of light verbs (Alonso Ramos, 2007). If a lexicographic representation aims at a de- scription of syntactic behavior of CPs (not only at compiling an inventory of collocations of pred- icative nouns and light verbs, as e.g., (Vincze and Csirik, 2010), (Paul, 2010)), the above given mechanisms should be reflected in the lexicon. To our knowledge, the most complex representation of CPs is provided in the Explanatory Combi- natorial Dictionary of Modern Russian (Mel cuk and Zholkovsky, 1984) where the collocational potential is captured by means of lexical functions (Mel cuk, 1996). The generation of well-formed syntactic structures with CPs is then based on the interplay of the lexical representation and gram- matical rules (Alonso Ramos, 2007). In Czech theoretical linguistics, there is only a limited number of studies devoted to CPs (Mach  a ckov  a, 1994), (Cinkov  a, 2009), (Radimsk  y, 2010), and (Kol  a rov  a, 2010); none of them presents a mechanism aspiring to provide a thorough explanation of syntactic behavior of CPs. Moreover, the only existing lexical resource with information on syntactic properties of light verbs PDT-Vallex provides only partial infor- mation that does not make it possible to establish the deep and surface syntactic structures of the re- sulting CPs (Ure sov  a, 2011). </chunk></section><section><heading>3 FGD Framework </heading><chunk>In this paper, we elaborate the representation of CPs within the Functional Generative Descrip- tion, a stratificational and dependency-oriented theoretical framework (Sgall et al., 1986). One of the core concepts of FGD is that of valency (Panevov  a, 1994): at the layer of linguistically structured meaning (called the tectogrammatical layer), valency provides the structure of a depen- dency tree. The valency theory of FGD has been applied in several valency lexicons. The most elaborate one of these is the VALLEX, Valency Lexicon of Czech Verbs, which forms a solid basis for the lexical component of FGD. VALLEX lexicon The VALLEX lexicon 2 has resulted from an at- tempt to document valency behavior of Czech verbs (Lopatkov  a et al., 2008). Over time, VALLEX has undergone many quantitative and qualitative extensions. Recent developments have focused on the linguistic phenomena that despite representing productive grammatical processes in- volving changes in the valency structure of verbs are lexically conditioned, esp. diatheses. For the purposes of the representation of phenomena at the lexicon-grammar interface, VALLEX is divided into a lexical part and a gram- matical part. The lexical part provides lexical representation of individual lexical units of verbs whereas the grammatical part represents formal representation of rules of the overall grammatical component of FGD that are directly connected to the valency structure of verbs. The central organizing concept of the lexical part of VALLEX is the concept of lexeme. The lexeme associates a set of lexical forms represent- ing the verb in an utterance, with a set of lexical units of a verb, corresponding to its senses. Each lexical entry of a verb is described by a set of attributes (see Fig. 2 below). The core attribute frame contains a valency frame that is modeled as a sequence of valency slots, each corresponding to a single valency complementation of the verb; each slot consists of (i) a functor a syntactico- semantic label reflecting the type of dependency relation of the given valency complementation, (ii) an indication of obligatoriness, and (iii) a list of possible morphemic forms specifying the usage of a lexical unit in the active voice. 2 http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/vallex 192 Of all the remaining attributes of lexical units currently employed in VALLEX, we shall further discuss the attribute diat, the value of which is a list of all applicable diatheses (as their appli- cability is lexically conditioned and thus has to be captured in the lexical part of VALLEX). In the grammatical part, grammatical rules describ- ing individual types of diatheses are formulated. When these rules are applied to the relevant lexi- cal units (as indicated by the attribute diat), all possible surface syntactic manifestations of a lex- ical unit in the marked structures of diatheses can be obtained (Kettnerov  a et al., 2012). </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Lexical Representation of CPs </heading><chunk>A CP, as a multiword lexical unit, is formed as a combination of a predicative noun with an ap- propriate light verb. It is primarily the predicative noun that contributes its semantic participants. Its ability to select different light verbs (and thus to create different CPs) makes it possible to embed the event expressed by the predicative noun into different general semantic scenarios and thus to perspectivize it from the point of view of differ- ent semantic participants. In this process, a crucial role is played by the referential identity of nomi- nal and verbal valency complementations within the CP (as it is demonstrated in Sect. 4.2.1). As a consequence, CPs can be described as a combination of the information from the valency frames of both the light verb and the predicative noun. Further, we propose to enhance VALLEX with three special attributes lvc, map and caus to capture possible combinations of these two syn- tactic elements into a single predicate (Sect. 4.2). </chunk></section><section><heading>4.1 Valency Frames </heading><chunk>It is widely acknowledged that both predicative nouns and light verbs have their own valency potentials, i.e., they have their own sets of va- lency complementations (Alonso Ramos, 2007), (Mach  a ckov  a, 1994). As a result, both light verbs and predicative nouns should be represented by their respective valency frames in the valency lex- icon. 4.1.1 Predicative Nouns Valency frames of predicative nouns underlie their deep dependency structures, both in nominal structures and as the nominal components of CPs, see examples (2) and (6) and the valency frame of the noun pokyn instruction in (1). 3 (1) pokyn PN instruction: ACT gen,pos ADDR dat PAT k +dat,inf (2) Pokyn PN st  atn  ho z  astupce N:ACT:gen zalob- c  um N:ADDR:dat (posuzovat p r  pad jako kr  a- de z) N:PAT:inf p ri sel pr  av e v cas. The instruction PN of the public prosecu- tor N:ACT to the prosecutors N:ADDR (to regard the case as a theft) N:PAT came just in time. Valency complementations of predicative nouns are endowed with semantic participants. For ex- ample, the noun pokyn instruction is character- ized by the participants Speaker, Recipient, and Information, which are mapped onto ACTor, ADDRessee, and PATient, respectively. 4.1.2 Light Verbs Valency frames of light verbs constitute the deep dependency structure of the verbal component of CPs. Formally, valency frames of Czech light verbs are prototypically identical to the valency frames of their full verb counterparts. 4 Hence we consider them to be inherited from the latter. The only reg- ular difference between the valency frames of light verbs and their full verb counterparts is the func- tor CPHR Compound PHRaseme, indicating the valency position of the predicative noun. Generally, valency complementations of a full verb correspond to its semantic participants; how- ever, light verbs are deprived of semantic partici- pants (Alonso Ramos, 2007). 5 For example, the valency frame of the light verb ud elit pf to give, to grant (4) is identical to the valency frame of the full verb (3), compare exam- ples (5) and (6). (3) ud elit to give: ACT nom ADDR dat PAT acc (4) ud elit LV to give: ACT nom ADDR dat CPHR acc (5) Prezident V:ACT:nom ud elil um elc  um V:ADDR:dat medaile V:PAT:acc . 3 As the information on obligatoriness is not relevant here, we omit it from the valency frames. 4 These findings are in line with the analysis of their mor- phological characteristics, which are also prototypically iden- tical with the properties of their full counterparts (Butt, 2010). 5 The only exception causative light verbs is addressed in Sect. 4.2.2. 193 The President V:ACT has awarded medals V:PAT to the artists V:ADDR . (6) St  atn  z  astupce V:ACT:nom ud elil LV zalob- c  um V:ADDR:dat pokyn V:CPHR:acc posuzovat p r  pad jako kr  ade z. The public prosecutor V:ACT has given an instruction V:CPHR to regard the case as a theft to the prosecutors V:ADDR . Despite the absence of semantic participants of light verbs, their valency complementations are not semantically depleted: they acquire their se- mantic content from the semantic participants of predicative nouns via coreference with nominal valency complementations, as proposed, e.g., by (Butt, 1998), here Sect. 4.2.1. Then only seman- tically specified valency complementations are in- herited from valency frames of full verb counter- parts of light verbs (Kettnerov  a and Lopatkov  a, 2013). 6 4.1.3 Linking Valency Frames: Attribute lvc For obtaining the deep dependency structure of a CP, the appropriate valency frames of the predica- tive noun and the light verb (with which the noun combines within the predicate) must be linked. In the VALLEX lexicon, the special attribute lvc, attached to individual valency frames of predica- tive nouns and (for convenience) also to those of light verbs, provides the list of references, see Fig. 1 and 2 below. </chunk></section><section><heading>4.2 Lexical Mapping </heading><chunk>The formation of well-formed deep and surface dependency structures with CPs requires a mech- anism to account for the distribution of nominal and verbal valency complementations in the re- sulting syntactic structures. In this section, we show that for these purposes, additional informa- tion on the coreference of valency complementa- tions (and thus on the mapping of semantic par- ticipants) has to be recorded as a part of lexical entries of predicative nouns and light verbs. This information is provided by two special attributes map (Sect. 4.2.1) and caus (Sect. 4.2.2). 6 However, the cases in which the number of valency com- plementations in the valency frame of a light verb is reduced are rather rare in Czech (e.g., within the CP p rijmout zod- pov ednost to accept responsibility, the valency frame of the light verb does not inherit the ORIGin complementation as it lacks semantic specification). 4.2.1 Nominal Participants: Attribute map As stated above, whereas the valency complemen- tations of a predicative noun are semantically sat- urated by its semantic participants, the valency complementations of the light verb are semanti- cally unspecified. To acquire semantic content, the verbal complementations enter in coreference re- lations with the nominal complementations. Pairs of nominal and verbal valency complementations within CPs thus exhibit referential identity (they refer to the same nominal semantic participant). This referential identity of verbal and nominal va- lency complementations represents a substantial characteristic of CPs. For example, the CP ud elit pokyn to give an in- struction can be characterized by three semantic participants given by the noun: Speaker, Re- cipient, and Information. These participants are mapped onto the nominal valency complementa- tions ACTor, ADDRessee, and PATient, see (1). The valency frame of the light verb in (4) com- prises three complementations: one (CPHR) is occupied by the predicative noun and the remain- ing two (ACTor and ADDRessee) represent com- plementations that are not semantically specified by the light verb; however, they gain their seman- tic capacity via coreference with nominal ACTor and ADDRessee, see (7) specifying the referential identity. (7) ud elit pokyn to give an instruction: Speaker N ACT N ACT V Recipient N ADDR N ADDR V Information N PAT N Due to the referential identity, all the valency com- plementations within this CP are semantically sat- urated. The event denoted by the predicative noun is perspectivized from the point of view of the Speaker, corresponding to the verbal ACTor (ex- pressed in the active structure in the most promi- nent subject position, see also example (6). Changes in the referential identity The referential identity of the valency complemen- tations may differ for different combinations of the same predicative noun combined with different light verbs (Kol  a rov  a, 2010), (Radimsk  y, 2010). For example, the referential identity within the CP ud elit pokyn to give an instruction (7) dif- fers from that of the predicate p rijmout pokyn 194 to receive an instruction (10). Within the lat- ter, the same set of semantic participants are em- ployed, i.e., Speaker, Recipient, and Informa- tion. However, the verbal ACTor and ORIGin gain their semantic specification via coreference with the nominal ADDRessee and ACTor, respec- tively, see (1), (8) and (10). (8) p rijmout LV to receive: ACT nom CPHR acc ORIG od+gen (9) Zalobci V:ACT:Recip p rijali LV od st  atn  ho z  astupce V:ORIG:Speak pokyn V:CPHR (posuzo- vat p r  pad jako kr  ade z) N:PAT:Info . The prosecutors V:ACT:Recip have received the instruction V:CPHR (to regard the case as a theft) N:PAT:Info from the public prosecutor V:ORIG:Speak . (10) p rijmout pokyn to receive an instruc- tion: Speaker N ACT N ORIG V Recipient N ADDR N ACT V Information </chunk></section><section><heading>N PAT </heading><chunk>N The referential identity of valency complementa- tions, provided in (10), reflects changes in the se- mantic specifications of verbal valency comple- mentations (see example (9) illustrating the map- ping) and also the change in the perspective from which the event expressed by the noun is viewed: in this case, the event is portrayed from the per- spective of the Recipient as the participant cor- responding to the verbal ACTor. Attribute map As referential identity has a direct influence on the syntactic structure of CPs, see Section 5, this in- formation has to be provided in the lexical part of the language description. As it is the predicative noun that selects an ap- propriate light verb, the attribute map giving a list of pair(s) of referentially identical nominal and verbal valency complementations is assigned to valency frames of predicative nouns. More than one attribute map (distinguished by numeral in- dexes) can appear in a lexical unit of a predica- tive noun to account for the possible differences in referential identity of valency complementa- tions within several CPs with the same predica- tive noun. Each attribute map is accompanied by a set of references to light verbs provided in the at- tribute lvc that comply with the given referential identity of valency complementations. The lexical entry is exemplified on the predicative noun pokyn instruction in Fig. 1. Figure 1: Simplified VALLEX lexical entry of the noun pokyn instruction. 4.2.2 Verbal Participant Causator: Attribute caus Typically, it is the predicative noun that deter- mines the number and roles of semantic par- ticipants characteristic of a CP. Light verbs of causative type, which are endowed with the se- mantic participant Causator, represent the only exception. With these verbs, Causator is con- tributed to CPs by the verb (in addition to the semantic participants provided by the predicative nouns). Figure 2: Simplified VALLEX lexical entry of the verb ud elovat/ud  let impf , ud elit pf to give. For example, the CP ud elit pr  avo to grant a right, see example sentence (12), is character- ized by three semantic participants: Causator, Bearer, and Theme. Causator, provided by 195 the light verb ud elit to grant (with the valency frame given in (4)), is mapped onto the verbal ACTor whereas Bearer and Theme given by the predicative noun pr  avo right correspond to the nominal ACTor and PATient, respectively, see the valency frame of the noun in (11). As the ver- bal ACTor is saturated by the semantic participant Causator, only ADDRessee is not semantically saturated; this ADDRessee acquires its semantic specification from the predicative noun via coref- erence with the nominal ACTor, see their referen- tial identity in (13). As a result, all valency com- plementations are semantically specified.

(13) ud elit pr  avo to grant a right: Causator V ACT V Bearer N ACT N ADDR V Name N PAT N Changes in the mapping of Causator The semantic participant Causator may be mapped not only onto the verbal ACTor but also onto another valency position of a light verb. Then the change in the mapping of Causator brings about further changes in the referential identity of nominal and verbal complementations. For example, within the CP z  skat pr  avo to ob- tain a right, see (15), the Causator contributed by the light verb z  skat to obtain maps onto the verbal ORIGin, see the valency frame of this light verb in (14). In this case, it is the verbal ACT- or that gains semantic content from the nominal ACTor (16). As a consequence, all the valency complementations within the CP z  skat pr  avo to obtain a right are semantically saturated.

(16) z  skat pr  avo to obtain a right: Causator V ORIG V Bearer N ACT N ACT V Name N PAT N Attribute caus The mapping of Causator onto valency com- plementations is relevant for both deep and sur- face structure formation, therefore it is captured by a special attribute caus assigned to valency frames of light verbs of causative type. This attribute lists the verbal valency complementa- tion onto which Causator is mapped, see the light verb ud elovat/ud  let impf , ud elit pf to give in Fig. 2. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Grammatical Rules for CPs </heading><chunk>The grammatical part of the VALLEX lexicon contains meta-rules describing the formation of deep (Sect. 5.1) and surface dependency structures of CPs (Sect. 5.2). These meta-rules are instanti- ated on the basis of the information stored in the lexical part of the lexicon. </chunk></section><section><heading>5.1 Deep Syntactic Structure </heading><chunk>The meta-rule for formation of the deep syntac- tic structure of a CP exploits a valency frame of a predicative noun and a valency frame of a light verb with which the noun combines (their compatibility is identified by the attribute lvc). Moreover, information on the referential identity of nominal and verbal valency complementations within a CP, given in the attribute map, as well as information on verbal Causator, given in the at- tribute caus (if applicable), is necessary for the identification of coreferences in the dependency tree of the CP. For example, the deep dependency structure of the CP ud elit pokyn to give an instruction is com- posed of the valency frame of the predicative noun pokyn instruction and that of the light verb ud elit to give given above in (1) and (4), respectively. Further, the deep structure of this CP is charac- terized by coreferential links, reflecting the refer- ential identity of the complementations, see (7), Fig. (17) (and Tab. 1 left part). 196 (17) On the other hand, the valency structure of the CP p rijmout pokyn to receive an instruction re- sults from the valency frames of the predicative noun pokyn instruction and that of the light verb p rijmout receive, given in (1) and (8), respec- tively, and from the referential identity provided in (10), see Fig. (18). (18) </chunk></section><section><heading>5.2 Surface Syntactic Structure </heading><chunk>For the formation of the surface syntactic struc- ture of a CP, its deep dependency structure is used (Sect. 5.1). In addition to the mapping of indi- vidual nominal and verbal complementations pro- vided by the attribute map (Sect. 4.2.1), also the mapping of the verbal Causator, provided by the attribute caus (Sect. 4.2.2), is necessary. Theoretical analysis has revealed that with CPs in Czech, each semantic participant is typically ex- pressed in the surface sentence just once. 7 Despite the fact that semantic participants are contributed with the exception of the verbal Causator by predicative nouns, Czech CPs have a strong ten- dency to express them in the surface structure as complementations of light verbs 8 (Mach  a ckov  a, 1994). We propose the following rules for the for- mation of the surface syntactic structure with CPs: All valency complementations from the valency frame of the light verb are expressed in the surface structure, namely: (i) the valency complementation filled by the predicative noun (the CPHR functor); (ii) the valency complementation corresponding to Causator (the attribute caus); 7 The only exception is represented by the semantic partic- ipant mapped onto nominal ACTor; under certain conditions, this participant can be expressed twice, both as a verbal and as a nominal complementation (e.g., Petr V :ACT:Bearer nevedl sv  uj N :ACT:Bearer zivot zrovna stastn e. Peter did not lead his life very happily.). 8 Rich morphology of Czech provides reliable clues for the identification of surface structure via morphemic cases. (iii) valency complementations that are referen- tially identical with a nominal complementa- tion (the attribute map). Only the following valency complementations from the valency frame of the predicative noun are expressed in the surface structure: (iv) valency complementations that are not ref- erentially identical with any verbal comple- mentation (i.e., those not listed in the at- tribute map). For example, within the CP ud elit pokyn to give an instruction characterized by the deep dependency tree (17) the predicative noun fills the CPHR verbal position (i); two verbal va- lency complementations are expressed in the surface structure (iii), namely the ACT V and ADDR V (referentially identical with the ACT N and ADDR N , referring to Speaker and Recip- ient, respectively); from the valency frame of the noun, only the PAT N (referring to Informa- tion) is expressed on the surface (iv); the two re- maining nominal complementations, ACT N and ADDR N , are unexpressed in the surface structure (as they are referentially identical with ACT V and ADDR V ), see Tab. 1 column 4. 5.2.1 Unmarked (Active) Form Morphemic forms of valency complementations of light verbs listed in the lexical part of the lexi- con correspond to the active form. Thus the rules given above directly establish the surface syntactic structure of CPs in the active form. For example, the surface structure of a sentence with the CP ud elit pokyn to give an instruction with the light verb in the active form can be ob- tained directly from morphemic forms recorded in the valency frames (1) and (4), see Tab. 1 col- umn 5, and Fig. 3, displaying the surface syntactic tree of sentence (19) in relation to its deep depen- dency tree.

( The surface expression is blocked by the deagentive diathesis.) Figure 3: The simplified deep (above) and sur- face (below) dependency trees of sentence (19). The vertical arrows show the surface syntactic manifestations of valency complementations. The nominal valency complementations unexpressed in the surface structure (due to their referential identity with the verbal ones) are in the gray field. 5.2.2 Marked (Passive) Forms: Interplay of the Rules The deep structure of a CP also serves as the basis for generating marked surface structures of diathe- ses. In this case, the rules for the formation of sur- face structures of CPs (Sect. 5.2 above) interplay with those for the formation of marked forms of diatheses (Vernerov  a et al., 2014). In Czech, five types of diathesis (passive, resul- tative, recipient-passive, deagentive, and disposi- tional) were determined (Panevov  a et al., 2014). Diatheses are accompanied by changes in the mor- phological category of verbal voice and they are prototypically associated with shifts of valency complementations in the surface structure (while the deep structure is preserved). These shifts are indicated by changes in morphemic forms of the involved valency complementations and are regu- lar enough to be captured by formal rules. These rules can be exemplified, e.g., by the rule for the recipient-passive diathesis: Rcp-pass d. verb form replace(active AuxV dostat + past participle) ACT replace(nom od+gen) ADDR replace(dat nom) The light verb and its full verb counterpart pro- totypically enter the same type of diatheses; the applicability of individual diatheses is provided by the attribute diat attached to the full verb. For example, the light verb ud elit to give, grant can create the following marked struc- tures (Fig. 2): passive (pass (20)), resulta- tive (res), recipient-passive (rcp-pass (21)), deagentive (deagent (22)), and dispositional (disp) diathesis.

The deep dependency structure of the CP (i.e., the num- ber and the type of its verbal and nominal va- lency complementations) is preserved whereas the surface syntactic expression of the verb and its complementations is changed as prescribed by the rule describing the respective diathesis (the sur- face form of the nominal valency complementa- tions remains unchanged). For example, the marked structure of the recipient- passive diathesis of the CP ud elit pokyn to give an instruction, as in (21), is underlain by the valency frame obtained by the application of the above given rule to the valency frame corresponding to the active form of the light verb in (4), see Tab. 1 column 7. </chunk></section><section><heading>6 Conclusion </heading><chunk>In this paper, we have focused on complex predi- cates consisting of a light verb and a predicative noun. We have proposed their theoretically ad- equate and economical description based on the interplay between the grammatical and the lexi- cal components of the language description. The special attributes lvc, map and caus, comply- ing with the logical structure of the VALLEX lex- icon as well as with the main tenets of the Func- tional Generative Description, were designed. The information provided in these attributes identi- fies recurrent patterns of light verb collocations (similarly as lexical functions into which it can be easily transferred), while grammatical rules in the grammatical component generate their well- formed (both deep and surface) dependency struc- tures. We have shown how the proposed rules combine with the rules describing diatheses. At present, a large-scaled lexicographic repre- sentation of light verbs is still missing despite the fact that these phenomena are widespread in the language (Kettnerov  a et al., 2013). We expect that the lexicon enriched with the information on light verbs will form a solid basis for their future inte- gration into NLP applications which can substan- tially contribute to verifying the results of the pro- posed theoretical analysis.
