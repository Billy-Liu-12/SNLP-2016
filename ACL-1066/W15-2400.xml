The workshop was endorsed by ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL). This is the sixth edition of related workshops first held with ACL 2007, EACL 2009, 2012 and 2014 and as a standalone event in 2013. The workshop is targeted at anyone interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding first, second and bilingual language acquisition and change or loss in normal and pathological conditions. The human ability to acquire and process language has long attracted interest and generated much debate due to the apparent ease with which such a complex and dynamic system is learnt and used on the face of ambiguity, noise and uncertainty. This subject raises many questions ranging from the nature vs. nurture debate of how much needs to be innate and how much needs to be learned for acquisition to be successful, to the mechanisms involved in this process (general vs specific) and their representations in the human brain. There are also developmental issues related to the different stages consistently found during acquisition (e.g. one word vs. two words) and possible organizations of this knowledge. These have been discussed in the context of first and second language acquisition and bilingualism, with cross linguistic studies shedding light on the influence of the language and the environment. The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and ma- chine learning methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous speech and language processing tasks, including e.g. speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing, lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue man- agement. The good results have generally been viewed as engineering achievements. Recently researchers have begun to investigate the relevance of computational learning methods for re- search on human language acquisition and change. The use of computational modeling is a relatively recent trend boosted by advances in machine learning techniques, and the availability of resources like corpora of child and child-directed sentences, and data from psycholinguistic tasks by normal and pathological groups. Many of the existing computational models attempt to study language tasks under cognitively plausible criteria (such as memory and processing limita- tions that humans face), and to explain the developmental stages observed in the acquisition and evolution of the language abilities. In doing so, computational modeling provides insight into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language processes, and inspires the development of better language models and techniques. These investigations are very important since if com- putational techniques can be used to improve our understanding of human language acquisition and change, these will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general but will reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to develop useful language models. We invited submissions on relevant topics, including: Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning and organization Computational models of first, second and bilingual language acquisition iii Computational models of language changes in clinical conditions Computational models and analysis of factors that influence language acquisition and use in different age groups and cultures Computational models of various aspects of language and their interaction effect in acqui- sition, processing and change Computational models of the evolution of language Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human language pro- cesses Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its impact on lan- guage processes Cognitively oriented Bayesian models of language processes Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their relevance to research on human language acquisition Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-supervised meth- ods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from a cognitive perspective.
