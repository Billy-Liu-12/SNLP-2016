We link lexical units from the manuscripts with the Multilin- gual Central Repository (MCR), making terms retrievable by any of the languages that integrate MCR. The goal of the project is twofold: creating a paleographic knowledge base from digitized medieval facsimiles, that will allow paleographers, philologist, histori- cal linguist, and humanities scholars in gen- eral, to analyze and retrieve graphemic, lexi- cal and textual information from historical documents; and on the other hand, develop- ing machine readable documents that will link image representations of graphemic and lexical units in a facsimile with Linked Open Data resources. This paper concentrates on the encoding and cross-linking procedures. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Introduction </heading><chunk>In recent years, historical documents have been massively digitized and published online in openly available databases, gathering much of the attention of the Digital Humanities communi- ty. As a result, large collections of historical handwriting online databases have emerged such as Pares 1 , paleographic resources like DigiPal 2 , citizen scholar projects (Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain 3 ) and digital paleography learning tools (Spanish Paleography Digital Teaching and Learning Tool 4 ). In this context, computerized tools have 1 http://pares.mcu.es/ 2 http://www.digipal.eu/ 3 http://decipheringsecrets.net/ 4 http://spanishpaleographytool.org/ become part of the toolkit of the current humani- ties scholar. Most of the research in the computational anal- ysis of digitized historical handwritten docu- ments, has concentrated in its paleographic anal- ysis: the deciphering, dating, and description of ancient manuscripts (Wolf, et. al, 2011; Hassner, et. al, 2013). In this paper, we describe an ongo- ing project for encoding digitized medieval Spanish manuscripts from the 13 th , 14 th and early 15 th centuries, and linking their content with the Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) 5 (Gonza- lez-Agirre et al., 2012). The main goal of the project is the develop- ment of an online database of digitized medieval manuscripts that will enable users to obtain gra- phemic and lexical information from facsimiles. Manuscripts will be fully searchable using any of the languages that integrate the MCR. The resource will aid the paleographic under- standing of medieval manuscripts as well as the linguistic and philological analysis of medieval Spanish. Also, the database can be a valuable source for computational researchers interested in the automatic processing of medieval manu- scripts, since image data will be linked to text and lexical information. To our knowledge, an online resource of this type does not exist. In this paper we concentrate on: the descrip- tion of the methods for transcribing, annotating, and encoding manuscripts; the process of auto- matically linking their content at a lexical level with MCR entries, and for codifying these rela- tionships in a model. </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Encoding transcriptions of medieval manuscripts </heading><chunk>Historical Spanish language varieties exhibit im- portant differences not only at the syntactical and 5 http://adimen.si.ehu.es/web/MCR/ 73 morphological level, but also at the graphemic. This is due to the fact that orthographic rules in Spanish were not defined until the 18 th century 6 , bringing serious difficulties for the understand- ing of Medieval Spanish 7 manuscripts, since there is substantial variation even within docu- ments of the same period; mostly because scribes had different handwriting styles. Medieval or- thography also does not follow contemporary patterns, there is not in a strict sense, different options between graphemes, but rather a combi- nation of factors that may explain certain solu- tions. As mentioned by Sanchez-Prieto (2004), medieval manuscripts should be understood following a triple correlation of factors: 1. Paleographic uses and shapes of the letters. 2. Identification of the letters. 3. Phonetic changes. In this triple relation lies the evolution of handwriting, and may reveal important aspects of phonetic change. For that reason, handwritten medieval documents are nowadays manually transcribed with the aid of computational tools. In Figure 1, two examples of different handwrit- ing styles from early 15 th century are shown, where the grapheme a at the end of each word, is written in a triangular shape (for the first word la), and in a square shape (for the second word buena). In our work, we segmented the tran- scribed words in manuscripts using the UVic Image Markup Tool 8 , which allows for the anno- tation and transcription of facsimiles using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI 9 ) model. We cus- tomize the markup of the TEI document to be able to codify graphemic and lexical information. Figure 1: Early 15 th century handwriting styles. The grapheme a is marked in a box. TEI is de facto XML standard for the repre- sentation of texts in digital form. Following TEI 6 The Royal Spanish Academy published the first ortho- graphic rules in 1726, as part of the first volume of the Dic- cionario de Autoridades. 7 Medieval Spanish is an early form of Spanish that ranges from the 10 th to the 15 th century, as it is considered by most scholars. 8 http://tapor.uvic.ca/~mholmes/image_mar kup/index.php 9 http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml. TEI is an XML-based file format for exchanging text. guidelines, different graphemic representations are declared using the element &lt;glyph&gt; in the header of the document (see Figure 2). Image representations of words in the facsimile are segmented using the element &lt;surface&gt;, which defines a written surface as a two-dimensional coordinate space, specifying zones of interest or grouping graphic representations within that space; and the &lt;zone&gt; element, that defines a two dimensional area within a &lt;surface&gt;. The attributes @ulx, @uly, @lrx and @lry, represent respectively, the x and y values for the upper left and lower right corners of a rectangular space (see Figure 3). Declarations of graphemes are linked to the transcribed text using the element &lt;g&gt;, so variations of a grapheme can be identi- fied and compared. Transcribed words are repre- sented in the TEI document using the &lt;w&gt; ele- ment. We automatically generate unique xml:id for each element in the TEI document. The nest- ed representation of words and graphemes in a facsimile is shown in Figure 4. &lt;encodingDesc&gt; &lt;charDecl&gt; &lt;glyph xml:id="a1"&gt; &lt;glyphName&gt; roman letter a with triangular shape&lt;/glyphName&gt; &lt;charProp&gt; &lt;locaName&gt; entity&lt;/localName&gt; &lt;value&gt;a1&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/charProp&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;graphic url="a1.png"/&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/glyph&gt; &lt;/charDecl&gt; &lt;/encodingDesc&gt; Figure 2: Grapheme declaration in TEI docu- ment. &lt;facsimile xml:id="imtAnnotatedImage"&gt; &lt;surface&gt; &lt;graphic url="DiegoHernandez.jpg" width="902px" height="1240px"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;zone xml:id="imtArea_1" ulx="298" uly="233" lrx="326" lry="253" rend="visible"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone xml:id="imtArea_2" ulx="326" uly="234" lrx="343" lry="251" rend="visible"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone xml:id="imtArea_3" ulx="344" uly="237" lrx="393" lry="254" rend="visible"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone xml:id="imtArea_4" ulx="345" uly="233" lrx="391" lry="252" rend="visible"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone xml:id="imtArea_5" ulx="363" uly="238" lrx="372" lry="251" rend="visible"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; 74 &lt;/surface&gt; &lt;/facsimile&gt; Figure 3: TEI representation of image segments in a facsimile. &lt;body&gt; &lt;div xml:id="imtImageAnnotations"&gt; &lt;s xml:lang="spa"&gt; &lt;w xml:id="ms1_w_6" cor- resp="#imtArea_1"&gt; por&lt;/w&gt; &lt;w xml:id="ms1_w_7" cor- resp="#imtArea_2"&gt;la&lt;/w&gt; &lt;w xml:id="ms1_w_8" cor- resp="#imtArea_3"&gt;gr&lt;g xml:id="ms1_g_1" corresp="#imtArea_4" ref="#a1"&gt;a&lt;/g&gt;cia&lt;/w&gt; &lt;w xml:id="ms1_w_9" cor- resp="#imtArea_5"&gt;de&lt;/w&gt; &lt;/s&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; Figure 4: text representation of words and graph- emes linked to their corresponding image seg- ments. </chunk></section><section><heading>3 Linking medieval manuscripts with </heading><chunk>multilingual lexical resources In order to link image representations of words in a historical variety with a multilingual lexical database, two operations need to take place: 1. Matching the historical form of the word with its contemporary standard. 2. Codifying that relation in the docu- ment. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.1 Mapping medieval Spanish with con- temporary standard </heading><chunk>Before the cross-linking of the transcribed words from the manuscript with MCR entries, words from medieval Spanish will need to be mapped to the standard form of contemporary Spanish. We follow the rules presented in (Sanchez- Prieto, 2004) and previous computational work on historical language varieties (Sanchez-Marco et. al, 2010). The mapping rules used can be divided into substring rules and word rules. In Table 1 examples of the mappings using substring rules are introduced. Words that are not covered by the substring rules include graphemic variation of the type: decaydodecaido, fablarhablar. Substring rules Medieval Modern Transformation euo evo nueuonuevo iua iva dadiuadadiva Table 1: substring rules </chunk></section><section><heading>3.2 Linking terms from medieval manu- scripts with MCR synsets </heading><chunk>WordNet is a large lexical database of English (Miller, 1995), where open class words are grouped into concepts represented by synonyms (synsets) that are linked to each other by semantic relations such as hyponymy and meronymy. There are multiple wordnets for different languages, and wordnets for groups of languages like the Euro WordNet (Vossen, 1998). Wordnets have also been extended by using external lexical resources like Wiktionary (McCrae et al., 2012) or with a combination of multilingual resources (De Melo &amp; Weikum, 2009; Bond &amp; Foster, 2013). Also, the Portuguese wordnet incorporates non standard varieties of the language (Marrafa et al., 2011). Our goal is to link words from historical varieties of Spanish extracted from manuscripts, to synsets in MCR, in such a way that the image representation of a medieval word can be directly associated to its contemporary form or via se- mantic relations to a sense. The MCR integrates wordnets in five different languages, English, Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician that are linked to each other via an Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI). Each of the wordnets in the MCR is aligned to the Princeton WordNet 3.0 and encoded using Lexicon Model for Ontol- ogies (lemon) 10 . One of the main advantages of using lemon is its linguistically sound structure based on the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF), making it an ideal model for lexicons and ma- chine-readable dictionaries in the Linked Data Cloud. We use a Python script for linking words from historical Spanish manuscripts encoded in a TEI document with existing MCR synsets, by match- ing lemmas in medieval Spanish with contempo- rary standard. We follow the substring and word mapping rules described in the previous subsec- tion, matching them with contemporary Spanish lemmas in MCR. This approach is imperfect, since there are medieval words that no longer exist or might have different lexical realizations. In these cases, medieval words will need to be 10 http://lemon-model.net/ 75 linked with synsets via the linguistic analysis of their meanings using a historical dictionary, fol- lowing an approach similar to the one described in (Declerck et al., 2014). Also, we should note that PoS-taggers of standard contemporary Span- ish used in a historical variety context, perform below state of the art taggers (Sanchez-Marco et. al, 2011), which makes manual verification an unavoidable step. In order to represent the semantic linking of the words in the TEI document with lexical entries in the lemon model of the MCR, we need to extend our initial TEI representation with pointing mechanisms associated to the TEI &lt;relation&gt; element. In Figure 5 we show how semantic relationships can be established between words in the manuscripts and external lexical resources. &lt;relation ref="http://www.lemon- model.net/lemon#formVariant" active="#ms1_w_8" passive =" mcr:spa-gracia-n#Sense- 04840715-n "/&gt; &lt;relation ref="http://wordnet- rdf.princeton.edu/ontology#translation" active="http://wordnet- rdf.princeton.edu/wn30/14458181-n" passive="#ms1_w_8"/&gt; Figure 5: semantic annotations to external re- sources. </chunk></section><section><heading>4 Next steps: sharing knowledge be- tween manuscripts </heading><chunk>In the encoding presented in this paper, manu- scripts are annotated, codified, and linked to ex- ternal lexical resources. Even though several paleographic and graphemic relations are estab- lished implicitly in the markup of the TEI docu- ment, this representation of a manuscript does not provide semantic relationships beyond the ones defined at a lexical level. In order to share paleographic knowledge with other open re- sources across the web, following Linked Open Data principles (Chiarcos et. al, 2011), a paleographic ontology for medieval Spanish documents needs to be develop. The ontology should capture relationships within a given document, between different manuscripts in a collection and between different collections. Allographs, glyphs, ligatures, word and common name abbreviations, contractions, acronyms, numbers and dates variations in notation should be defined at an ontological level. More general relationships and document data such as typology (legal, church, private document, etc), style, place of origin, manuscript collection, archive, author and year of the transcription, will also be included in the ontology. Since we are dealing with cultural heritage materials, existing ontologies such as the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM), and more directly related to our work, the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD), already define the terminology and some of the relationships that can be found in medieval manuscripts; in these cases classes can be directly imported and reused. In some other cases, classes may need to be created to define specific graphemic objects and paleographic relationships that are not defined in the existing ontologies. In the TEI representation described in this pa- per, unique ids are given to lexical and graphem- ic units, allowing for the automatic creation of URIs that can be used for external resources to link to it. The RDF annotation can be done fol- lowing the example given in Figure 5 using the element &lt;relation&gt; and the relationships defined in the paleographic ontology. At a lexical level, semantic relations are estab- lished in the TEI document via external re- sources. Even though lexical ontologies such as lemon, and to some extent WordNet, define lin- guistic relationships between lexical units, they may not be specific enough to describe the dif- ferent relationships of a language with its histori- cal varieties. Future steps in the project should consider adding such detailed linguistic relation- ships. </chunk></section><section><heading>5 Conclusions </heading><chunk>In this paper we described the first steps towards the creation of an online resource of digitized medieval Spanish manuscripts, where graphemic, lexical and textual information can be retrieved directly from facsimiles. We have shown and demonstrated a method for transcribing and en- coding in TEI P5 image data from manuscripts. We have described also how medieval Spanish can be linked to its contemporary standard and to the rest of the languages that integrate MCR, making manuscript terms retrievable using any of these languages. Next steps in the project in- clude: developing a paleographic ontology of 76 medieval Spanish, extending semantic annota- tions at a lexical level incorporating historical varieties relationships, building a web interface, and making data available in the cloud. </chunk></section><section><heading>References </heading><chunk>Bond, F., &amp; Foster, R.
