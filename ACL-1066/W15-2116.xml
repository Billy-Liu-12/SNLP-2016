Reconstructions of Deletions in a Dependency-based Description of Czech: Selected Issues Eva Haji cov  a and Marie Mikulov  a and Jarmila Panevov  a Charles University in Prague Faculty of Mathematics and Physics Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics Czech Republic {hajicova,mikulova,panevova}@ufal.mff.cuni.cz Abstract The goal of the present contribution is to put under scrutiny the language phe- nomenon commonly called ellipsis or deletion, especially from the point of view of its representation in the underlying syn- tactic level of a dependency based syntac- tic description. We first give a brief ac- count of the treatment of ellipsis in some present day dependency-based accounts of this phenomenon (Sect. 1). The core of the paper is the treatment of ellipsis within the framework of the dependency-based formal multi-level description of language called Functional Generative Description: after an attempt at a typology of ellip- sis (Sect. 2) we describe in detail some selected types of grammatical ellipsis in Czech (Sect. 3). In Sect. 4 we briefly sum- marize the results of our analysis. </chunk></section><section><heading>1 Treatment of ellipsis in dependency based descriptions of language </heading><chunk>There are not many treatments of ellipsis in the framework of dependency grammar. Hudsons original conviction presented in his word gram- mar (WG, (Hudson, 1984)) was that syntactic theory could stick firmly to the surface with de- pendency relations linking thoroughly concrete words. Under this assumption, such elements as those for which transformational grammar has postulated deletions, traces or unpronounced pro- nouns such as PRO and pro were part of seman- tics and did not appear in syntax. In his more re- cent work, (Hudson, 2007), pp. 267-281 revised this rather extreme position; he presents an anal- ysis of examples of structures such as You keep talking (sharing of subjects), or What do you think the others will bring (extraction) or case agree- ment in predicatives (in languages such as Ice- landic and Ancient Greek, where adjectives and nouns have overt case inflection and predicative adjectives agree with the subject of their clause) demonstrating that their description cannot be rel- egated to semantics. He concludes that covert words have the same syntactic and semantic char- acteristics expected from overt words and, conse- quently, he refers to them as to the unrealized words. He proposes to use the same mechanism used in the WG theory: namely the realization relation linking a word to a form, and the quan- tity relation which shows how many instances of it are expected among the observed tokens. If the quantity of the word is zero then a word may be unrealized. Every word has the potential for being unrealized if the grammar requires this. An unreal- ized word is a dependent of a word which allows it to be unrealized, thus the parent word controls re- alization in the same way that it controls any prop- erty of the dependent. One of the crucial issues for a formal descrip- tion of ellipsis is the specification of the extent and character of the part of the sentence that is being deleted and has to be restored. Already in the papers on deletion based on the transforma- tional type of description it has been pointed out that the deleted element need not be a constituent in the classical understanding of the notion of con- stituent. A natural question offers itself whether a dependency type of description provides a more adequate specification in terms of a dependency subtree. (Osborne et al., 2012) proposed a novel unit called catena defined as a word or a com- bination of words that is continuous with respect to dominance. Any dependency tree or subtree (complete or partial) of a dependency tree quali- fies as a catena. The authors conclude that based on the flexibility and utility of this concept, catena may be considered as the fundamental unit of syn- tax and they attempt to document this view by their analysis of different kinds of ellipsis (gap- ping, stripping, VP ellipsis, pseudogapping, sluic- 131 ing and comparative deletion, see (Osborne and Liang, 2015)). The issue of ellipsis as a mismatch between syntax and semantics is most explicitly reflected in those dependency frameworks that work with several levels of syntactic representation. This is the case of the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) of I. Mel cuk and the Functional Generative Descrip- tion (FGD) of P. Sgall. In the framework of the multilevel approach of MTT the rules for surface syntactic ellipsis are part of surface syntax component and they are de- fined as various kinds of reductions and omis- sions, possible or obligatory in a given context . . . ( (Mel cuk, 1988), p. 83). For the surface syntax representation the author distinguishes be- tween zero signs and ellipsis. Zero lexes and lex- emes are covered by the term syntactic zeroes (op. c., p. 312) and due to their sign character they are reflected in the dictionary entries. On the other hand, an ellipsis is a rule, i.e. a part of the gram- mar, that eliminates certain signs in certain sur- face contexts. (op. c., p. 326). </chunk></section><section><heading>2 Treatment of ellipsis in the Functional Generative Description </heading><chunk>In the dependency-based theory of the Functional Generative Description (FGD) we subscribe to (see esp. (Sgall et al., 1986)) the treatment of el- lipsis is determined by the fact that this theoreti- cal framework works with two syntactic levels of the sentence, namely with a level representing the surface shape of the sentence and the level repre- senting the underlying, deep syntactic structure of the sentence (so-called tectogrammatical level). 1 Simplified examples of representations on these two levels for sentence (1) are presented in Fig. 1. (1) Jan John se Refl. rozhodl decided opustit to leave Prahu. Prague In the surface structure representation each ele- ment of the sentence is represented by a node of its own (more exactly, by the form given in the dictio- nary) and no words are added. The dependency re- 1 FGD served as a theoretical background of the annota- tion scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT in the sequel; see (Bej cek et al., 2013)). PDT also distinguishes an analytic syntactic level (surface) and a tectogrammatical, deep level. In the present contribution, we discuss deletions from the point of view of the theoretical approach and quote PDT only when necessary for the understanding of the point under discussion. For the treatment of deletions in the PDT see (Haji c et al., 2015). Figure 1: Simplified representations of the sen- tence (1) Jan se rozhodl opustit Prahu [John de- cided to leave Prague.] on the surface (above) and on the tectogrammatical (below) levels. The arrow indicates the coreferential relation. lations have the values such as SUBJ, OBJ, ADV etc. In the tectogrammatical tree (TR in the se- quel), only autosemantic lexical units are repre- sented by a separate node of the tree; the informa- tion carried by the function words in the surface structure is represented in the tectogrammatical structure by means of complex symbols attached to the given node (e.g. the so-called grammatemes of modality, tense, etc. or the subfunctors for the meanings carried by the prepositions etc.). The semantic relation between the head and its modi- fier(s) is reflected by the functor(s), such as ACT, PAT, ADDR, LOC, CPR, RSTR etc., which are, if needed, supplied by more subtle syntactico- semantic distinctions reflected by the subfunctors. The issue of ellipsis 2 concerns the relations be- tween these two dependency trees. It is obvious that for an adequate representation of meaning el- ements of different dimensions absent on the sur- face need to be included in the TR. We call these elements ellipsis. The phenomenon of ellipsis is caused by several factors: (i) by the structure of the text (discourse), (ii) by grammatical rules or conditions, (iii) by an obligatory grammatically determined 2 In the present discussion, we use the terms deletion and ellipsis as synonyms though we are aware that in some frameworks their meanings do not overlap. 132 surface deletability of an element the pres- ence of which is required by the grammatical system. Type (i) is called a textual ellipsis, as it is ba- sically connected with the structure of discourse, 3 and the types (ii) and (iii) are called systemic (or grammatical) ellipsis; the type (iii) is referred to here as pseudodeletion. In the case of grammati- cal ellipsis the surface sentences (the remnants) without the elliptical elements satisfy the condi- tions for grammatically well-formed structures; however, in order to achieve a representation of the meaning of the sentence these elements have to be filled (often using artificial nodes) in the tree even if the result of the restoration of the deletion may be stylistically awkward or even grammati- cally hardly acceptable in the surface shape of the sentence. On the borderline between the types (i) and (ii) there is the surface deletion of subject in Czech as a language with the property of a pro- drop language. 4 </chunk></section><section><chunk>3 The FGD treatment of selected types of systemic ellipsis in Czech  As already mentioned above, one of the crucial is- sues for a formal description of ellipsis is the spec- ification of the extent of the part of the sentence that has to be restored. The extent of the restora- tions varies from type to type, from the more eas- ily identifiable with the restoration of ellipsis in pro-drop cases to the least identifiable structures to be inserted in cases of deletions in coordination. In our discussion below we will concentrate on four types of systemic ellipsis in Czech with which we intend to illustrate the different possibilities and difficult points of reconstructions; we leave aside deletions in coordinated structures, which is a problem of its own and the discussion of which would go beyond the limits of this contribution. While in 3.2 3.4 the problem how the items absent on the surface are to be reconstructed in TRs (as to their structure and extent), in 3.1 the reconstruction on TR is quite simple, it concerns a single node and it is manifested by the morpho- 3 So-called textual ellipsis typical for the spoken lan- guage and dialogues is left aside here, outside a broader con- text these sentences may be ungrammatical (as is the second sentence in Have you finished your manuscript? Not yet com- pletely.). Their analysis is a subject of studies on discourse structure. 4 For a detailed classification of ellipsis in Czech, see (Mikulov  a, 2011). logical categories of verb. We face here an oppo- site problem: how to explain the conditions where pro-dropped subjects are overtly expressed. In 3.1 we give only several examples with overt sub- jects in 1st and 2nd person without their deep anal- ysis. By this preliminary picture of the problem we wanted to demonstrate that Czech really be- longs to the pro-drop class of languages (see Ta- ble 1). </chunk></section><section><heading>3.1 The pro-drop parameter in Czech </heading><chunk>Czech belongs to languages of the pro-drop type (called sometimes zero subject or null-subject). Surprisingly, the absence of an overt subject in 1st and 2nd person was not described prop- erly in traditional Czech grammatical handbooks (cf. (Havr  anek and Jedli cka, 1960), p. 300 and in (Karl  k et al., 1995), pp. 411412.). The anal- ysis of this phenomenon is given in more details in contrastive studies, esp. in those comparing Czech and Russian, because these two closely re- lated languages differ as to their pro-drop proper- ties. 5 Since the examples with missing pronouns of 1st and 2nd person are considered as unmarked for Czech, 6 while the overt presence of the pro- nouns in 1st and 2nd person as marked counterex- amples, the conditions or requirements for their presence need to be listed. For the 1st person sg the following issues are mentioned in the books quoted above: (i) the verb forms do not indicate fully the source for the agreement categories (see (2)), (ii) the contrasting position of the pronoun with regard to the other element (see (3)), (iii) the stressed po- sition of the pronoun (often at the beginning of sentence, see (4)), (iv) the pronoun participates in a coordination chain (see (5)), and finally (v) the stylistic feature expressing pleasant or unpleasant emotions (see (6)): 7 (2) J  a byl v zdycky tak trochu pobuda. I have always been a kind of a lounger. 5 A detailed analysis is given in (Isa cenko, 1960), Vol 2, pp. 411f.; the authors approach seems to be too radical as to the difference between non pro-drop Russian contrary to the pro-drop Slovak; he proposed to analyse Russian construc- tions as Ja splju [I am sleeping] with obligatory subject pro- noun ja [I] as an analytical verb form. 6 In this section we do not pay an attention to the 3rd per- son; its position on the scale of deleted elements is different due to its role of anaphora. 7 The occurrence of pronouns in marked positions in (1) through (11) is denoted by italics; these examples are taken over from the different parts of the Czech National Corpus, namely SYN2010 and SYN2013PUB. 133 (3) Byli bohat  , j  a jsem byl chud  y. [They] were rich, I was poor. (4) Ten cl  anek jsem psal j  a. The article I wrote. (5) M  uj p r  tel a j  a jsme ode sli z policejn  ho u radu. My friend and I left the police station.

I am so happy, Radek, that I do not need to play with you any longer. The ellipsis of 1st person pl and 2nd sg and pl are not analyzed in the quoted books at all, we present here only several examples of the marked positions untypical for a pro-drop language: (7) My We si Refl. na for n eho him po ck  ame, wait, neute ce he will not escape n  am. us.

Both meanings of the pronoun vy [you], i.e. the honorific form and the sim- ple plural form would be difficult to distinguish in the corpus without syntactic annotation. However these occurrences are marginal, so that they do not influence the statistics substan- tially. corpus SYN2005 SYN2010 SYN2013 PUB corpus size (# of tokens) 100M 100M 935M Verbs in 1 st person sg 1 142 609 1 787 638 8 906 455 Pronoun j  a [I] is present 77 629 74 922 244 667 non-dropped 6,8% 4,2% 2,7% Verbs in 2 nd person sg 293 068 496 304 2 966 819 Pronoun ty [you] is present 10 265 17 328 9 779 non-dropped 3,5% 3,5% 0,3% Verbs in 1 st person pl 635 962 821 381 8 501 392 Pronoun my [we] is present 18 213 19 986 153 275 non-dropped 2,9% 2,4% 1,8% Verbs in 2 nd person pl 379 487 498 943 1 093 271 Pronoun vy [you] is present 16 596 17 344 65 707 non-dropped 4,4% 3,5% 6,0% Table 1: Non pro-drop vs. pro-drop sentences dropness is demonstrated in the non-dropped rows: e.g. in the corpus SYN2005 there are 6,8% sentences within the set of all predicates in 1st per- son sg where the subject j  a [I] is present (non- dropped). </chunk></section><section><heading>3.2 Coreference with raising and control verbs as pseudo-deletions </heading><chunk>With regard to our aim to introduce into the deep (tectogrammatical) representation all semantically relevant information even though not expressed in the surface shape of the sentence, the coreferential units important for the interpretation of the mean- ing of the sentence in infinitive constructions have to be inserted. Neither speaker nor recipient are aware of any deletion in (12) and (13) (and other examples in this Section), both sentences are fully grammatical. Thus, for the interpretation of the meaning of (12) it is necessary to know that in (12) Actor (John) is identical with absent subject of the infini- tive clause, see Figure 1 above, while in (13) the Addressee (girl-friend) occupies such an empty position. These elements (indicated in PDT by the lemma #Cor) are needed for the completion of the tectogrammatical structure. Infinitive clauses with some verbs of control are in particular contexts synonymous with the corre- sponding embedded clauses (12b), (13b): 134 (12) a. Jan se rozhodl opustit Prahu. John decided to leave Prague. b. Jan se rozhodl, ze (on) opust  Prahu. John decided that (he) would leave Prague. (13) a. Jan doporu cil p r  telkyni p rest ehovat se. John recommended to his girl-friend to move. b. Jan doporu cil p r  telkyni, aby se (ona) p rest ehovala. John recommended to his girl-friend that (she) moved. Another argument for the treatment of these structures as deletions is the fact that with some verbs the surface shape of the sentence is am- biguous: thus with the Czech verb slibovat [to promise] there are two possibilities of control (the subject of the infinitive may corefer either with the Actor or with the Addressee of the main clause) that have to be captured by the TR. Thus the sen- tence (14) can be understood either as (15a) with the Actor as the controller or as (15b) with the Ad- dressee as the controller: (14) Jirka sl  bil d etem j  t do divadla. George promised the children to go to the theatre. (15) a. Jirka sl  bil d etem, ze (on) p  ujde do di- vadla. George promised the children that (he) will go to the theatre. b. Jirka sl  bil d etem, ze (ony) p  ujdou do divadla. George promised the children that (they) will go to the theatre. The specificity of this type of deletion is caused by the fact that the deleted unit subject (Sb) of the infinitive cannot be expressed on the surface. Raising and control constructions belong to the prominent topics of the studies in gen- erative grammar, though different terminol- ogy and different solutions are used ((R  u zi cka, 1999), (Przepi  orkowski and Rosen, 2005), (Rosen, 2006), (Landau, 2013), to name just a few con- tributions from the last 20 years). 9 (Panevov  a, 9 (R  u zi cka, 1999), p.4: . . . an infinitival S-complement 1996) and (Panevov  a et al., 2014) base the solution on the classification of verbs of control according to their controller (examples (12) and (13) repre- sent group 1 and 2 with Actor (controller) Sb (controlee) and Addressee (controller) Sb (con- trolee), respectively). The other groups are rep- resented by the Czech verbs slibovat [to promise] with two possibilities of control (Actor - Sb or Ad- dressee - Sb, see (15a), (15b)) and poslat [to send] with the control Patient - Sb (see (16)). (16) S  ef poslal asistenta rozn  est let  aky. The boss sent the assistant to distribute the leaflets. Our discussion indicates that we have resigned on the difference between raising and control, 10 because according to the analysis of Czech data, the tests (such as passivization, identity or differ- ence in theta-roles, the number of arguments of the head verb) prominently used in generative gram- mar for English do not function for our data in the same way. In this Section we wanted to document that phenomena analyzed here and called pseudo- deletions are justified to be considered as a type of deletion, as the meaning of infinitive construc- tions can be explained only by an establishment of explicit pointers of the coreferential expressions between the argument of the governing verb and unexpressed subject of the dependent predicate. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.3 Special types of small clauses </heading><chunk>A sequence of two prepositions following one an- other is excluded in Czech but there are expres- sions in Czech 11 classified in traditional descrip- tions and dictionaries mostly as prepositions that can be followed by a prepositional noun group. (17) Krom e do katedr  aly p  ujdou turist  e do musea. 12 creates the problem of reconstituting its empty sub- ject; (Landau, 2013), p. 9: . . . the interpretation of the sen- tence [with control] indicates that there is an additional, invis- ible argument in the embedded clause, which is coreferential with (found/controlled by) the overt DP. 10 (Landau, 2013), p. 257 concludes his exhaustive analy- sis of the phenomena analyzed usually under the roof of rais- ing/control by the claim that control is neither a unitary phe- nomenon nor a constitutive element of grammatical theory, but rather a heuristic label only serving to draw our attention to a certain class of linguistic facts. 11 Equivalent expressions in other languages (e.g. in Rus- sian), of course, exist, but as far as we know, they do not share the properties we describe for Czech in this Section. 12 The variant krom e + Genitive (krom e katedr  aly p  ujdou 135 Besides to the cathedral the tourists will go to the museum. (18) a. M  sto do Uppsaly p rijel Jan do Trond- heimu. Instead at Uppsala John arrived at Trondheim. b. M  sto, Instead of aby that (Jan) (John) p rijel arrived do at Uppsaly, Uppsala, p rijel arrived Jan John do at Trondheimu. Trondheim. In our proposal the double functions concen- trated in small clauses introduced by krom e, m  sto [besides, instead of] are differentiated by means of the addition of the missing predicate with the lexical label repeating the lexical value of the governing predicate. The adverbials do kat- edr  aly (in (17)), do Uppsaly (in (18)) depend on the restored node with their proper function of Di- rection. The expanded representation for (18a) is paraphrased in (18b). We deal here with examples (17) and (18) in de- tail, because they document clearly that the (lexi- cally parallel) predicate is missing on the surface. However, there are examples where the preposi- tion m  sto [instead of] is used with its regular case rection (Genitive), being sometimes synony- mous with the small clause with double preposi- tions, e. g. (19), (20): (19) M  sto zav ren  eho musea(Genitive) nav st  v  turist  e katedr  alu. Instead of closed museum(Genitive) the tourists will attend a cathedral. (20) M  sto man zela(Genitive) doprovod  matku na ples syn. Instead of her husband(Genitive) her son will accompany mother to the ball. There are two possible approaches how to rep- resent (19) and (20) on TR: In the former case, the . . . [besides the cathedral they will go . . . ] where the expres- sion krom e can function as a proper preposition governing genitive case exists in Czech, too, but it is not applicable in all contexts. E.g. Krom e s p r  telem p  ujde Marie do divadla se sestrou [lit. Besides with the boy-friend Mary will go to the theatre with her sister] cannot be changed into *Krom e p r  tele p  ujde Marie do divadla se sestrou.[*Besides the boy- friend Mary will go to the theater with her sister.] expressions m  sto muzea/m  sto man zela [instead of museum/instead of husband] could be repre- sented as adjuncts of SUBST(itution) directly de- pendent on the predicate (visit or accompany, re- spectively). In the latter case, in order to achieve a symmetric representation of (18) on the one side and (19), (20) on the other, the restored version (with a repeated predicate) will be used. We pre- ferred the latter solution which helps to eliminate an ambiguity such as in (21) paraphrased in (22a) and (22b): (21) M  sto profesorky kritizoval studenta d ekan. Instead of the (lady)professor-Gen-F the dean criticized the student. (22) a. M  sto Instead of aby that kritizoval he-criticized profesorku the (lady)professor-Acc-F , , kritizoval criticized d ekan the dean studenta. the student-Acc-F Instead of critizing the lady- professor, the Dean critized the student. b. M  sto Instead of aby that studenta the student-Acc-F kritizovala criticized profesorka (lady)professor-Nom-F , , kritizoval criticized ho him d ekan. the dean. Instead of the student having been criticized by the lady-professor, he was criticized by the Dean. In the primary meanings of these two sentences in their restored (expanded) versions the noun profesorka [lady-professor] after the preposition m  sto [instead of] has the function of the subject (Actor) in (22b), while in (22a) profesorka [lady- professor] has the function of object (Patient). There are additional problems connected with the expression krom e. This Czech expression has two meanings corresponding approximately to be- sides (inclusion) and with exception (exclusion). At the same time, both have the same syntactic properties. Sentences (23a) and (24a) and their proposed expansions (23b) and (24b) illustrate the two different meanings of structures with krom e. 136 (23) a. (Tento p r  mo rsk  y hotel nab  z  vynikaj  c  slu zby.) Krom e v mo ri tam m  u zete plavat (i) v baz  enu. (This seaside hotel offers excellent services.) Besides in the sea you can swim there (also) in the pool. b. Krom e toho, Besides that ze that tam there m  u zete you-can plavat swim v in mo ri, sea, m  u zete you-can tam there plavat swim (i) (also) v in baz  enu. pool. For (24a) we propose the extended tectogram- matical representation as paraphrased in (24b): (24) a. Krom e v pond el  m  u zete nav st  vit mu- seum denn e od 10 do 18 hodin. With the exception on Mondays you can visit the museum daily from 10 AM till 6 PM. b. Krom e toho, ze nem  u zete nav st  vit museum v pond el  , m  u zete nav st  vit museum denn e od 10 do 18 hodin. With exception of the fact that you cannot visit the museum on Monday, you can visit the museum daily from 10 AM to 6 PM. The restored versions of the small clauses serve also as the means how to remove the ambigui- ties in krom e-phrases. 13 If in the extended ver- sion with the restored predicate both predicates are positive or both are negated, the krom e-phrases mean inclusion (called Addition in (Panevov  a et al., 2014)); if one of them is positive and the other negated, the phrases express an exclusion (called Exception in (Panevov  a et al., 2014)). Unfortu- nately, such a clear-cut criterion does not exclude all possible ambiguities. There are tricky contexts where the ambiguity could be removed only by a broader context or by the situation, see (25) and its two possible expansions in (26a) and (26b): (25) Vydala jsem v  yk rik, kter  y krom e Artura musel sly set kdekdo. I have given a scream which besides Arthur must have been heard by every- body. 13 For a detailed analysis of these constructions including other peculiarities occurring in Czech see (Panevov  a et al., 2014). (26) a. Vydala jsem v  yk rik, kter  y krom e toho, ze ho sly sel Artur, musel sly set kdekdo. I have given a scream which in ad- dition to that it was heard by Arthur must have been heard by everybody. b. Vydala jsem v  yk rik, kter  y krom e toho, ze ho nesly sel Artur, musel sly set kdekdo. I have given a scream which in addi- tion to that it was not heard by Arthur must have been heard by everybody. The restructuring proposed for the type of sen- tences analyzed in this Section by means of an ad- dition of the predicate corresponding to the gov- erning predicate seems to be helpful from two points of view: One concerns the introduction of the means for splitting two functions conflated in the small clauses and the other is reflected in a more subtle classification of the list of adverbials adding an Addition and Exception as two new se- mantic units (functors) on tectogrammatical level. </chunk></section><section><heading>3.4 Deletions in structures with comparison </heading><chunk>Comparison structures are a very well known problem for any description pretending on restora- tion of elements missing in the surface shape to reach a complete representation of syntax and se- mantics of the sentences. In FGD two types of the comparison are distinguished: one is connected with the meaning of equivalence (introduced usu- ally by the expression jako [as]; the subfunctor used in PDT has the label basic), the other ex- presses the meaning of difference (it is introduced usually by the conjunction ne z [than]; the subfunc- tor used is called than). There are some compar- ison structures where the restoration of elements missing on the surface seems to be easy enough from the point of view of semantics and from the point of view of the extent of the part inserted in the TR (see (27a), and its restored version (27b)). (27) a. Jan cte stejn  e knihy jako jeho ka- mar  ad. John reads the same books as his friend. b. Jan cte stejn  e knihy jako ( cte) jeho ka- mar  ad. John reads the same books as his friend (reads). 137 Most comparisons are, unfortunately, more complicated, see the following examples and the arguments for the necessity of their extension: (28) a. Jan se choval na banketu jako v hos- pod e. John behaved at the reception as in the pub. b. Jan se choval na banketu (stejn e), jako se (Jan) chov  a v hospod e. John behaved at the reception (in the same way) as (John) behaves in the pub. In ex. (28a) we encounter a similar problem to the one we analyzed in Sect. 3.3. when discussing the modification of substitution, addition and of exception: in the comparison structure two se- mantic functions are conflated (comparison-basic and locative meaning in (28a)). Thus an artifi- cial predicate sharing in this case the same value as the governing predicate (with the syntactic la- bel comparison-basic) must be added into the ex- tended representation. It serves as the head for the locative adverbial, too. For many modifications of comparison, how- ever, even a more complex reconstruction of com- parison small clauses is needed. For an ade- quate interpretation of the surface shape of (29a) not only the shortened comparison structure with locative has to be expanded but also an opera- tor indicating similarity of the compared objects is missing. For the identification of the similarity the expression as stejn  y/stejn e [same/identically], podobn  y/podobn e [similar/similarly] are used and this operator has to be added into the correspond- ing TR, see ex. (29b). (29) a. Po zadavky jsou u Komer cn  banky jako u Cesk  e spo ritelny. The requirements are at Commercial Bank as at Czech Saving Bank. b. Po zadavky Requirements jsou are u at Komer cn  Commercial banky Bank (stejn  e) (same) jako as (jsou po zadavky) (are requirements) u at Cesk  e spo ritelny Czech Saving Bank [#Some]. [#Some]. An adequate description of the type of compari- son exemplified by ex. (29) (see Figure 2) requires Figure 2: Deep structure of (29) to add not only an artificial predicate the head of which copies the lemma of the main predicate, but also an operator indicating the type of comparison (#Equal, here with the meaning stejn  y [the same]). The artificial lemma #Some is used to stand for the lexically underspecified adjective/adverbial for both types of comparison, see (29b) and (30b). While the extension of (29a) would be accept- able (at least semantically) in the form Po zadavky jsou u Komer cn  banky stejn  e jako (jsou stejn  e) u Cesk  e spo ritelny [The requirements are at Com- mercial Bank the same as (are the same) at Czech Saving Bank], such type of extension is not acceptable with the comparison-than type (con- nected with the comparison of objects which are not similar), see (30). This sentence requires an artificial extension because the operators used for this type of comparison as jin  y/jinak [different], rozd  ln  y [different] have no semantic counterpart to be filled in the extended representation. The extension by the adjective n ejak  y [some] is given here by the fact that jin  y has no single lexical coun- terpart for the expression of the Ministry situation in (30) (if the situation there is different, the ap- propriate adjective is actually unknown, it is un- derspecified). (30) a. Situace v arm  ad e je jin  a ne z na minis- terstvu. The situation in the army is different than at the Ministry. b. Situace v arm  ad e je jin  a ne z (je situ- ace) na ministerstvu [#Some]. The situation in the army is different than (the situation) at the Ministry is [#Some]. Our experience with the analysis of data in PDT indicates that the relations between the extension 138 of comparison modifications and the extent of their complete structure on the deep level differ very significantly, so that a more detailed classi- fication would be useful. 4 Summary We have analyzed four types of elided construc- tions in Czech and proposed their representation on the deep (tectogrammatical) level of syntac- tic description within a formal dependency-based description. From the point of view of the bi- nary relation of the governor and its dependent, either the governor or the dependent may be miss- ing and has to be reconstructed. A reconstruction of a dependent is e.g. the case of deletions con- nected with the pro-drop character of Czech ([I] came late), or in cases of a deleted general argu- ment (John sells at Bata [what][to whom]), while a governor has to be reconstructed mostly in coordi- nated structures (John likes Bach and Susan [likes] Beethoven; We know when [she came] and why she came). In some types of deletions, the reconstruc- tion concerns an introduction of a rather complex structure which is, however, needed for an appro- priate semantic interpretation of the surface shape of the sentence, as illustrated by the comparison phrases and structures representing Addition and Exception. Our analysis focused on several types of the so-called systemic ellipsis, i.e. such that is given by grammatical rules or conditions or by a grammatically determined surface deletability; we have left aside textual ellipsis such as coordina- tion, which is conditioned mostly by the context or by situation. Surface deletions reflect the openness of the lan- guage systems to compress the information. How- ever, for the description of meaning of such com- pressed structures more explicit means for an ade- quate and unambiguous description are needed.
