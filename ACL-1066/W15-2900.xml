However, until quite recently, human affect was regarded in a dual manner - positively, for its regulatory power and negatively, as a sort of a "weakness" of the human spirit, that should ideally be rational, logical, *thinking* in a very matter of fact and consequence-based fashion. Recent discoveries in Neuropsychology and the possibilities opened by the functional Mag- netic Resonance Imaging have made it clear that emotions play a very important role for the well-functioning of the human body, both psychologically, as well as physically. Apart from the importance emotions have for each human being individually, research in Social Psychology and disciplines such as Marketing, Mass-media Communication or Political Science, has shown time and time again that the emotional discourse, its content - in words with affective connotation and the combination thereof - is of paramount difference between the success and failure of social actions, consumer products or political candidates. Given that nowadays messages with (sometimes) high emotional connotations are so easily shared using Social Media platforms and that their high volume makes manual sifting mostly im- possible, the automatic processing of Subjectivity, Sentiment and Emotions in texts, especially in Social Media contexts is highly relevant. Bearing these observations in mind, the aim of the 6th Workshop on Computational Ap- proaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2015) was to continue the line of the previous editions, bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. Starting with 2013, WASSA has extended its scope and focus to Social Media phenomena and the impact of affect-related phenomena in this context. The past two editions have shown important breakthroughs in dealing with the challenges of these types of texts, in monolingual, multilingual and cross-domain contexts. WASSA 2015 was organized in conjunction to EMNLP 2015: the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, on September 17, 2015, in Lisboa, Portugal. For this years edition of WASSA, we received a total of 48 submissions, from universities and research centers all over the world, out of which 8 were accepted as long and another 16 as short papers. Each paper has been thoroughly reviewed by at least 2 members of the Program Committee. The accepted papers were all highly assessed by the reviewers, the best paper re- ceiving an average punctuation (computed as an average of all criteria used to assess the papers) of 4.8 out of 5. The main topics of the accepted papers are related to challenges in dealing with language and domain diversity in Social Media - the creation and evaluation of resources for subjectivity, sentiment and emotion resources for Twitter mining, but also the use of the particular structure of Social Media texts to improve the sentiment and subjectivity classification. Additionally, articles presenting valuable work concentrating on building lexica for this field demonstrate that there is still a high requirement to develop such resources, taking into account deeper levels of annotations that are inspired by theories in Psychology. Finally, some articles deal with the issue of sentiment visualization and the use of such tools to improve the performance of automatic systems for emotion detection and classification. iii This years edition has again shown that the topics put forward to discussion by WASSA are of high interest to the research community and that the papers chosen to be debated in this forum bring an important development to the SSA research area. We would like to thank the EMNLP 2015 Organizers and Workshop Chairs for the help and support at the different stages of the workshop organization process. We are also especially grateful to the Program Committee members and the external reviewers for the time and effort spent assessing the papers. We would like to extend our thanks to our invited speaker Dr. Zornitsa Kozareva - for accepting to deliver the keynote talk, opening a new path of collaboration between two very closely-linked topics - emotions and metaphors. Secondly, we would like to express our gratitude for the official endorsement we received from SIGSEM - the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Semantics, SIGWAC - the Special Interest Group of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) on Web as Cor- pus, SIGANN - the ACL Special Interest Group for Annotation - and SIGNLL - ACLs Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning. We would like to express our gratitude to Yaniv Steiner, who created the WASSA logo and to the entire Europe Media Monitor team at the European Commission Joint Research Centre, for the technical support they provided.
