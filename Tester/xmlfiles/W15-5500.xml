Shoumen, BULGARIA ii Introduction NLP started to use extensively LOD in various scenarios, such as: exploring knowledge datasets (DBPedia, FreeBase, GeoNames, etc.) for annotation and information extraction; publishing language resources as LOD (WordNet, FrameNet, etc.); aggregating of the available data for various tasks (BabelNet, Global WordNet Grid); creation of standards for LOD (LEMON); building ontologies for different domains. At the same time, the NLP processing pipelines have been developed towards the recognition and extraction of entities and events from raw stream data. Handling of events, however, requires also the inclusion of high quality modules like NER, NED, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), sense and valency annotation. These modules rely not only on canonical resources, but also on the LOD datasets for extracting information about people, facts, and organizations. Additionally NLP techniques are used for creation of LOD datasets on the basis of new textual information. Since there is some experience gained now in the interaction between NLP and LOD as well as between LOD and NLP, some problems have been identified, too. These are: general failure of NLP technology to meet completely the requirements of LOD; incompleteness of LOD datasets; sparseness of LOD datasets through various languages and domains; lack of robust reasoning mechanisms in NLP and LOD; still inefficient handling of natural language non-literal phenomena, such as metonymy, polysemy, figurative expressions; usability and re-usability of NLP and LOD applications. Thus, a number of issues are related to the interaction between NLP and LOD. These are: reasons for low precision and inconsistencies; enhancing NLP applications with LOD; information extraction from LOD using NLP techniques; manipulating LOD (cleaning, adding information, deleting information, reconstructing facts) with NLP techniques; LOD as a corpus; mapping LOD to common sense ontologies and language data; storing LOD in RDF bases; methodological and theoretical approaches to LOD; handling polysemy and metonymy of entities in LOD; incompleteness of LOD data; LOD as unbalanced data through countries, cultures and topics of interest; insufficient reasoning in NLP and LOD; dynamics of LOD and NLP: versioning, replication, provenance, etc. There are 6 papers accepted at the workshop. They cover the following topics: resources for Linked Open Data; representation of language phenomena in Linked Open Data; unified access to Linked Open Data and an ontology-based POS tagger using unifications of different tagsets. We wish you a pleasant reading!
