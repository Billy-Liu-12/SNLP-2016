Sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN), this years SIGHAN-8 workshop is being held in Beijing, China, on July 30-31, 2015, and is co-located with ACL-IJCNLP 2015. The workshop program includes three keynote speeches, research paper presentations and two Bake-offs. We hope that these events will bring together researchers and practitioners to share ideas and developments in various aspects of Chinese language processing. We have received 17 valid submissions, each of which has been assigned to three reviewers. After a rigorous review process, we have accepted 5 papers for oral presentations (30% acceptance rate) and 6 papers for poster presentations, representing a global acceptance rate of 65%. We are honored to welcome our distinguished speakers: Dr. Min Zhang (Distinguished Professor, Soochow University, China) and Rou Song (Professor, Beijing Language and Culture University, China) will give the first keynote speech "Discourse and Machine Translation." Yanxiong Lu and Lianqiang Zhou (WeChat Pattern Recognition Center at Tencent) will speak on "Intelligent Q&amp;A System and NLP Open Platform." Finally, Dr. Lun-Wei Ku (Assistant Research Fellow, Academia Sinica, Taiwan) will speak on "From Lexical to Compositional Chinese Sentiment Analysis." We would also like to thank the Bake-off organizers. The first task Chinese Spelling Check task was organized by Dr. Yuen-Hsien Tseng (National Taiwan Normal University), Dr. Lung-Hao Lee (National Taiwan Normal University), Dr. Li-Ping Chang (National Taiwan Normal University), and Dr. Hsin-Hsi Chen (National Taiwan University). The second Topic-Based Chinese Message Polarity Classification task is organized by Dr. Xiangwen Liao (Fuzhou University, China), Dr. Ruifeng Xu (Harbin Institute of Technology, China), Dr. Li Binyang (University of International Relation, China), and Dr. Liheng Xu (Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). A total of sixteen teams participated in these two tasks and have achieved good results. Finally, we would like to thank all authors for their submissions. We appreciate your active participation and support to ensure a smooth and successful conference. The publication of these papers represents the joint effort of many researchers, and we are grateful to the efforts of the review committee for their work, and to the SIGHAN committee for their continuing support. We wish all a rewarding and eye-opening time at the workshop.

It has not been well studied in the research community of computational linguistics, but it has attracted more and more attention in very recent years. This talk consists of two parts, i.e., discourse and machine translation. We will first give an overview about discourse and review the research state-of-the-art of discourse from both linguistics and computational viewpoints, and then discuss how machine translation can benefit from discourse-level information. Finally, we conclude the talk with some future direction discussions. Biography ZHANG Min: a distinguished professor and vice dean of the school of computer science and technology, director of the research Institute for Human Language Technology at Soochow Uni- versity (China), received his Ph.D. degree in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology (China) in 1997. He has studied and worked oversea in industry and academy at South Korea and Singapore since 1997 to 2013. His current research interests include machine translation and natu- ral language processing. He has co-authored 2 Springer books and more than 130 papers in leading journals and conferences, and co-edited 13 books published by Springer and IEEE. He is an asso- ciate editor of IEEE T-ASLP (2015-2017). SONG Rou: a professor and Ph.D. supervisor at Applied Linguistics and Computer Applica- tion in Beijing Language and Culture University, received his Bachelor degree in mathematics and mechanics from Beijing University in 1968 and his mater Master degree in computer science from Beijing University in 1981. He has been working on Chinese Information Processing study for tens of years as the PIs of more than 10 national-level projects with the research focuses on discourse analysis, Chinese word segmentation, Computer-aided proofreading, Chinese word at- tribute, Chinese Orthographic Computing and Chinese POS and so on. He has published more than 100 papers at leading journals and conferences in computer science and linguistics. He has developed and commercialized several softwares with two patents.

He has been appointed as guest professors in a few domestic and oversea universities and research institutes. v Invited Talk: Intelligent Q&amp;A System and NLP Open Platform LU Yanxiong and ZHOU Lianqiang WeChat Pattern Recognition Center, Tencent Abstract Building a general Q&amp;A system that can handle any subject is a very challenging AI task. Internet social platforms accumulate large amount of active users and UGC (User Generate Content) data, which become valuable crowdsourcing resources. In this talk, we will discuss the opportunity of using WeChat crowdsourcing resources to build an intelligent Q&amp;A systems as well as some open questions and challenges under this topic. Tencent Open Platform "Wen Zhi" provides comprehensive natural language processing APIs, including the modules of Lexical, Syntax, Semantics and Paragraph. It also provides the web crawling, data extraction and transcoding services. In this talk we will give an overview of Ten- cent NLP open platform as well as the techniques behind. Biography LU Yanxiong is the senior researcher of WeChat Pattern Recognition Center, Tencent. He has been working on search query analysis, Q&amp;A system and NLP related projects in Tencent. His current work focus on WeChat semantic analysis. His research interests include search engine, machine learning, NLP and big data analysis. Before joining in Tencent, Yanxiong worked in Baidu and graduated from Xidian University with master degree. ZHOU Lianqiang has been working in the field of NLP and machine learning in Tencent, such as search query re-write, user interests mining, word segmentation, etc. He is now the senior re- searcher and team leader of NLP research group in Tencent Intelligent Computing and Search Lab. Before joining Tencent Lianqiang worked in several Internet companies and got his master degree from Harbin Institute of Technology. vi Invited Talk: From Lexical to Compositional Chinese Sentiment Analysis KU Lun-Wei Academia Sinica, Taiwan Abstract Sentiment analysis determines the polarities and strength of sentiment-bearing expressions, and it has been an important and attractive research area due to its close affinity to applications. In the past research, sentiment analysis depended highly on lexical semantics. However, sentiment analysis is eager for the understanding of the context, and shallow features such as bag of words cannot fulfill this need. As a result, compositional semantics, which concerns the construction of meaning based on syntax, has been applied to sentiment analysis through different approaches. In the Chinese language, as morphological structures may represent the compositional semantics inside Chinese words, the compositional sentiment analysis can even start from determining the sentiment of morphemes, which will be touched in this talk. This talk will begin from some background knowledge of sentiment analysis, such as how senti- ment are categorized, where to find available corpora and which models are commonly applied, especially for the Chinese language. I will describe our work on compositional Chinese sentiment analysis from words to sentences. All our involved and recently developed related resources, in- cluding Chinese Morphological Dataset, Augmented NTU Sentiment Dictionary (aug-NTUSD), E-hownet with sentiment information, and Chinese Opinion Treebank, will also be introduced in this talk. Ill end by describing how we have begun to test our compositional model with word embeddings.
