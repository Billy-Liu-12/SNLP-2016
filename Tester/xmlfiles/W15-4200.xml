Introduction and Overview After half a century of computational linguistics, quantitative typology, empirical, corpus-based study of language, and computational lexicography, researchers in computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) or information technology as well as in digital humanities are confronted with an immense wealth of linguistic resources; and these are not only growing in number, but also in their heterogeneity. Accordingly, the limited interoperability between linguistic resources has been recognized as a major obstacle for data use and re-use within and across discipline boundaries, and represents one of the prime motivations for adopting linked data in our field. With the rise of the Semantic Web, new representation formalisms and novel technologies have become available, and different communities are becoming increasingly aware of the potential of these developments with respect to the challenges posited by the heterogeneity and multitude of linguistic resources available today. Many of these approaches follow the Linked (Open) Data paradigm. The LDL workshop series and LDL-2015 are organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group to bring together researchers from various fields of linguistics, NLP, and IT to present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for representing, publishing and linking linguistic data collections, and aims to facilitate the exchange of technologies, ideas and resources across discipline boundaries, that (to a certain extend) find a material manifestation in the emerging LLOD cloud. LDL-2015, collocated with ACL-IJCNLP 2015, the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics and the 7th Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing in July 2015 in Beijing, China, is the fourth workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics following LDL-2012 (March 2012 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany), LDL-2013 (Sep 2013 in Pisa, Italy), and LDL-2014 (May 2014, Reykjavik, Iceland), as well as more specialized events such as the workshops on Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE- 2012: Sep 2012 in Leipzig, Germany, MLODE-2014: Sep 2014 in Leipzig, Germany), and Natural Language Processing and Linked Open Data (NLP&amp;LOD-2013: Sep 2013 in Hissar, Bulgaria), and the theme session on Linked Data in Linguistic Typology (at the 10th Biennial Conference of the Association for Linguistic Typology, ALT-2013, Aug 2013 in Leipzig, Germany), as well as presentations, panels and informal meetings at various conferences. LDL-2015 is organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) of the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Ontology-Lexica Community (OntoLex) Group 1 . Like LDL-2014, LDL-2015 is supported by the EU Projects LIDER and QTLeap: The project Linked Data as an Enabler of Cross- Media and Multilingual Content Analytics for Enterprises Across Europe (LIDER) aims to provide an ecosystem for the establishment of linguistic linked open data, as well as media resources metadata, for a free and open exploitation of such resources in multilingual, cross-media content analytics across Europe. The project Quality Translation with Deep Language Engineering Approaches (QTLeap) explores novel ways for attaining machine translation of higher quality that are opened by a new generation of increasingly sophisticated semantic datasets (including linked open data) and by recent advances in deep language processing. For the 4th edition of the workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics, we invited contributions discussing the application of the Linked Open Data Paradigm to linguistic data in various fields of linguistics, natural language processing, knowledge management and information technology in order to present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for representing, publishing and linking mono- and multilingual linguistic and knowledge data collections, including corpora, grammars, dictionaries, wordnets, translation memories, domain specific ontologies etc. 1 http://www.w3.org/community/ontolex iii In this regard, the Linked Data Paradigm provides an important step towards making linguistic data: i) easily and uniformly queryable, ii) interoperable and iii) sharable over the Web using open standards such as the HTTP protocol and the RDF data model. As a result of preceding LDL workshops and the activities of the communities involved, a considerable amount of linguistic linked open data resources has been established, so that our community is now increasingly aiming to shift the focus from resource creation to resource linking and further to the development of innovative applications of these resources in linguistics and NLP. For the current issue of LDL, we thus focus on resouces and applications. Accordingly, LDL-2015 provides a forum for researchers on natural language processing and semantic web technologies to present case studies and best practices on the exploitation of linguistic resources exposed on the Web for natural language processing applications, or other content-centered applications such as content analytics, knowledge extraction, etc. The availability of massive linked open knowledge resources raises the question how such data can be suitably employed to facilitate different NLP tasks and research questions. Following the tradition of earlier LDL workshops, we encouraged contributions to the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud and research on this basis. In particular, this pertains to contributions that demonstrate an added value resulting from the combination of linked datasets and ontologies as a source for semantic information with linguistic resources published according to as linked data principles. Another important question to be addressed in the workshop is how natural language processing techniques can be employed to further facilitate the growth and enrichment of linguistic resources on the Web. iv Invited Talk by Key-Sun Choi In addition to full and short papers/dataset descriptions, LDL-2015 will feature Key-Sun Choi as an invited speaker. Key-Sun Choi is professor of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, since 1988, where he had been Head of Computer Science Department (2006-2011) and recently founded the KAIST research group on Open Knowledge Convergence (since 2012). Key- Sun Choi has contributed to Department of Knowledge Service Engineering and Graduate School of Information Security in KAIST as a Joint Professor. He founded and directed Korterm (Korea Terminology Research Center for Natural Language and Knowledge Engineering, 1998) and Bora (National Research Resource Bank for Language and Annotation, 2003). He had been an invited researcher in NEC C&amp;C Lab of Japan (1987-1988), a visiting scholar of CSLI of Stanford University (1997), and an invited researcher of NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories (2002). His areas of expertise are natural language processing, ontology and knowledge engineering, semantic web and linked data, and their infrastructure including text analytics. He served as President (2009-2010) of AFNLP (Asia Federation of Natural Language Processing), the President (2006) of Korean Cognitive Science Society, and the Secretary of ISO/TC37/SC4 for language resource management standards since 2002. Recent key areas of his work are entity linking and predicate linking from text to DBpedia-like knowledge-bases and the enrichment of text, mainly for Korean. In his talk, he will focus on this line of research and address aspects of lexicalizing ontologies, mapping local properties to ontologies, extracting base ontologies and enhancing multilingualism in DBpedia. As organizers of LDL-2015, we are happy to welcome Key-Sun Choi as key note speaker to the workshop and look forward for fruitful discussions on the interface of Semantic Web and NLP in Beijing. v Organizers: Christian Chiarcos, Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt, Germany Philipp Cimiano, Universitat Bielefeld, Germany Nancy Ide, Vassar College, NY John P.
