Eighth Street Stroudsburg, PA 18360 USA Tel: +1-570-476-8006 Fax: +1-570-476-0860 acl@aclweb.org ISBN 978-1-941643-65-5 ii Preface The workshop series, Named Entities WorkShop (NEWS), focus on research on all aspects of the Named Entities, such as, identifying and analyzing named entities, mining, translating and transliterating named entities, etc. The first of the NEWS workshops (NEWS 2009) was held as a part of ACL-IJCNLP 2009 conference in Singapore; the second one, NEWS 2010, was held as an ACL 2010 workshop in Uppsala, Sweden; the third one, NEWS 2011, was held as an IJCNLP 2011 workshop in Chiang Mai, Thailand; and the fourth one, NEWS 2012, was held as an ACL 2012 workshop in Jeju, Korea. The current edition, NEWS 2015, was held as an ACL-IJCNLP 2015 workshop in Beijing, China. The purpose of the NEWS workshop series is to bring together researchers across the world interested in identification, analysis, extraction, mining and transformation of named entities in monolingual or multilingual natural language text corpora. The workshop scope includes many interesting specific research areas pertaining to the named entities, such as, orthographic and phonetic characteristics, corpus analysis, unsupervised and supervised named entities extraction in monolingual or multilingual corpus, transliteration modeling, and evaluation methodologies, to name a few. For this year edition, 5 research papers were submitted, each paper was reviewed by at least 2 reviewers from the program committee. The 5 papers were all chosen for publication, covering named entity recognition and machine transliteration, which applied various new trend methods such as deep neural networks and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Following the tradition of the NEWS workshop series, NEWS 2015 continued the machine transliteration shared task this year as well. The shared task was first introduced in NEWS 2009 and continued in NEWS 2010, NEWS 2011, and NEWS 2012. In NEWS 2015, by leveraging on the previous success of NEWS workshop series, we released the hand-crafted parallel named entities corpora to include 14 different language pairs from 12 language families, and made them available as the common dataset for the shared task. In total, 7 international teams participated from around the globe, while one team withdrew their results at the evaluation phase. Finally, we received 6 teams submissions. The approaches ranged from traditional learning methods (such as, Phrasal SMT-based, Conditional Random Fields, etc.) to somewhat new approaches (such as, neural network transduction, integration of transliteration mining, hybrid system combination). A concrete study and targeted process between two languages often generate better performances. A report of the shared task that summarizes all submissions and the original whitepaper are also included in the proceedings, and will be presented in the workshop. The participants in the shared task were asked to submit short system papers (4 content pages each) describing their approaches, and each of such papers was reviewed by at least two members of the program committee to help improve the quality. All the 6 system papers were finally accepted to be published in the workshop proceedings. We hope that NEWS 2015 would provide an exciting and productive forum for researchers working in this research area, and the NEWS-released data continues to serve as a standard dataset for machine transliteration generation and mining. We wish to thank all the researchers for their research submission and the enthusiastic participation in the transliteration shared tasks. We wish to express our gratitude to CJK Institute, Institute for Infocomm Research, Microsoft Research India, Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Centre and The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)/Sarvnaz Karimi for preparing the data released as a part of the shared tasks. Finally, we thank all the program committee members for reviewing the submissions in spite of the tight schedule. iii Workshop Organizers: Min Zhang, Soochow University, China Haizhou Li, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore Rafael E Banchs, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore A Kumaran, Microsoft Research, India Xiangyu Duan, Soochow University, China July 31, 2015 Beijing, China iv Organizers: Min Zhang, Soochow University, China Haizhou Li, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore Rafael E Banchs, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore A Kumaran, Microsoft Research, India Xiangyu Duan, Soochow University </chunk></section><section><heading>Program Committee: </heading><chunk>Rafael E.
